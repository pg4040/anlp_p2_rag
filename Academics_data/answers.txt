The MSAII is a master's program that combines artificial intelligence and machine learning curricula with real-world team experience in identifying AI market niches and developing products. The program focuses on intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship and leads to a capstone project, equipping graduates to begin startups or develop new organizations within established companies.
Generally, students holding undergraduate degrees in computer science, software engineering, bioinformatics, or bioengineering are eligible to apply.
To earn the MSAII degree, students must pass courses in the Core Curriculum, the Knowledge Requirements, and Electives, culminating in a capstone project. In total, students will complete 195 eligible units of study, including 84 units of Core Curriculum, 72 units of Knowledge Requirements, at least 36 units of approved Electives, and the LTI Practicum.
The Core Curriculum is a five-course sequence covering the four main phases of innovation development, including 11-651 Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets, 17-762 Law of Computer Technology, 11-695 AI Engineering, 11-654 AI Innovation, and 11-699 Capstone Project.
The Knowledge Requirements comprise six rigorous courses ensuring students can develop advanced AI applications, such as 11-601 Coding Bootcamp, 10-601 Machine Learning, 10-605 Machine Learning with Large Datasets, 11-611 Natural Language Processing, an AI-, NLP-, or ML-related course, and 11-785 Deep Learning.

Only with the permission of the MSAII director can students take courses other than the approved electives for elective credit.
Historically, students benefit from passing the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems before starting the program. Though not counted towards the 192 eligible units, failing this course results in taking 15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems instead.
The MIIS program concentrates on recognizing and extracting meaning from text, spoken language, and video, with extensive coverage of content analysis and machine learning.
MIIS students gain practical experience through software development under the supervision of their advisor (equivalent to 24 units or two courses); a summer internship (optional for those with sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in collaboration with peers (equivalent to 42 units or three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course).
The MIIS program is offered in two options: Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16), a 16-month track, and Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21), a 21-month track.
Three examples of course schedules are provided for each track: MIIS-16 Example Course of Studies #1, #2, and #3, and MIIS-21 Example Course of Studies #1, #2, and #3.
MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses), while MIIS-21 students need to complete at least 108 units (typically 9 courses) to satisfy their degree requirements. Both sets of requirements aim to fulfill breadth requirements in human language, machine learning, and language technology applications.
Part-time education might be available in certain cases, but the handbook recommends checking with the appropriate office for eligibility and availability.
