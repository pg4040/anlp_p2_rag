Academic Program Name:
Language Technologies Concentration

https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/lt-concentration.html

Overview:
Human language technologies have become an increasingly central component of computer science. Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.

Requirements:
Students interested in the language technologies minor must complete our prerequisite courses with an average grade of B (3.0) or better before applying to the program. (Students who do not meet this average must submit a letter of explanation along with their application.) Prerequisites include:
Principles of Imperative Computation (15-122)
Principles of Functional Programming (15-150)
We also strongly encourage candidates to take:
Differential and Integral Calculus (21-120) and Integration and Approximation (21-122)
Matrices and Linear Transformations (21-241) or Matrix Theory (21-242)
Probability and Computing (15-259) or Probability (21-325) or Probability Theory for Computer Scientists (36-218) or Introduction to Probability Theory (36-225)

Curriculum:
The Language Technologies Concentration requires that SCS students complete one core course and their choice of three elective courses of at least 9 units each. The electives can be chosen from a specific set of stand-alone courses. In addition to the four courses, students are required to do an undergraduate research project for at least 9 units to complete their concentration.
