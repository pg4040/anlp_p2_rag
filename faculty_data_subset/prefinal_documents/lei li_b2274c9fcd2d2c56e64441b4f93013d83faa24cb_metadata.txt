Title: An ultrahigh-fidelity 3D holographic display using scattering to homogenize the angular spectrum
Year: 2023
Abstract: A three-dimensional (3D) holographic display (3DHD) can preserve all the volumetric information about an object. However, the poor fidelity of 3DHD constrains its applications. Here, we present an ultrahigh-fidelity 3D holographic display that uses scattering for homogenization of angular spectrum. A scattering medium randomizes the incident photons and homogenizes the angular spectrum distribution. The redistributed field is recorded by a photopolymer film with numerous modulation modes and a half-wavelength scale pixel size. We have experimentally improved the contrast of a focal spot to 6 × 106 and tightened its spatial resolution to 0.5 micrometers, respectively ~300 and 4.4 times better than digital approaches. By exploiting the spatial multiplexing ability of the photopolymer and the transmission channel selection capability of the scattering medium, we have realized a dynamic holographic display of 3D spirals consisting of 20 foci across 1 millimeter × 1 millimeter × 26 millimeters with uniform intensity.
