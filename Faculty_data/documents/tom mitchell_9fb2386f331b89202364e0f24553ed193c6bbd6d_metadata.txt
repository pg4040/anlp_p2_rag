Title: H2 generated by fermentation in the human gut microbiome influences metabolism and competitive fitness of gut butyrate producers
Year: 2023
Abstract: None
Authors: Austin Campbell, K. Gdanetz, A. Schmidt, T. Schmidt
Venue: Microbiome
Tldr: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'H_2 is a regulator of fermentation in the human gut microbiome and stimulates production of the anti-inflammatory metabolite butyrate, which is of particular interest due to its role as a mediator of colonic health through anti- inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties.'}
