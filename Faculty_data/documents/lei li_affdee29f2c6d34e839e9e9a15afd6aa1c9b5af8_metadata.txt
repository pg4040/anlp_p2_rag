Title: Polydopamine-functionalized selenium nanoparticles as an efficient photoresponsive antibacterial platform
Year: 2023
Abstract: A photoresponsive therapeutic antibacterial platform was designed and constructed using polydopamine-functionalized selenium nanoparticles as a carrier loaded with indocyanine green (Se@PDA-ICG). The therapeutic platform was confirmed by characterization and the antibacterial activity of Se@PDA-ICG against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) was investigated. Under 808 nm laser irradiation, the antibacterial rate of Se@PDA-ICG against E. coli and S. aureus was 100% at 125 μg mL−1. Furthermore, in a mouse wound infection model, the wound closure rate of the Se@PDA-ICG photoresponse group was 88.74% compared with 45.8% for the control group after 8 days of treatment, indicating that it could effectively kill bacteria and dramatically accelerate the wound healing process. These results suggested that Se@PDA-ICG could be a promising photo-activated antibacterial candidate material for biomedical applications.
