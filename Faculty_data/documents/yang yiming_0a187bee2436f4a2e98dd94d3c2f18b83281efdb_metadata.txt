Title: Automatic synchrotron tomographic alignment schemes based on genetic algorithms and human-in-the-loop software
Year: 2023
Abstract: A highly automatic alignment scheme is proposed to address the pressing challenge in tomographic alignment of future scanning tomography experiments. The results show that the proposed method exhibits excellent sub-pixel alignment accuracy and high time efficiency.
