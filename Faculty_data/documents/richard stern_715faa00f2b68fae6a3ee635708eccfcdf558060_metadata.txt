Title: Automatic Detection of Dyspnea in Real Human–Robot Interaction Scenarios
Year: 2023
Abstract: A respiratory distress estimation technique for telephony previously proposed by the authors is adapted and evaluated in real static and dynamic HRI scenarios. The system is evaluated with a telephone dataset re-recorded using the robotic platform designed and implemented for this study. In addition, the original telephone training data are modified using an environmental model that incorporates natural robot-generated and external noise sources and reverberant effects using room impulse responses (RIRs). The results indicate that the average accuracy and AUC are just 0.4% less than those obtained with matched training/testing conditions with simulated data. Quite surprisingly, there is not much difference in accuracy and AUC between static and dynamic HRI conditions. Moreover, the beamforming methods delay-and-sum and MVDR lead to average improvement in accuracy and AUC equal to 8% and 2%, respectively, when applied to training and testing data. Regarding the complementarity of time-dependent and time-independent features, the combination of both types of classifiers provides the best joint accuracy and AUC score.
