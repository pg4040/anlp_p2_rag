Tldr: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is shown that the previously unannotated protein TMEM241 is required for cholesterol egressing from lysosomes through amphotericin B-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 KO screening and is a Golgi-localized UDP-GlcNAc transporter and loss ofTMEM241 causes cholesterol accumulation in lysoomes because of the impaired M6P-dependent lysOSomal targeting of NPC2.'}
