Research
I work at the intersection of human-computer interaction, human computation, crowdsourcing, artificial intelligence and natural language processing.
The future my research envisions is one in which the intelligent systems that we have dreamed about for decades — that have inspired generations of computer scientists from its beginning — are brought about for the benefit of people in their everyday lives.
My work is achieving this vision by leveraging on-demand human labor to fill in for components that we cannot currently automate, and by building frameworks that allow groups to do together what even expert individuals cannot do alone. A crowd-powered world seems counter to the goals of computer science, but by creating and deploying the systems of our dreams, we will learn to create the machines that will someday realize them.
