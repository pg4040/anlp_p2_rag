Title: Effects of STN‚ÄêDBS surgery on cerebral glucose metabolism and distribution of DAT in Parkinson's disease
Year: 2023
Abstract: : Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to be an effective treatment for PD; however, the effects of this surgery on cerebral metabolism and presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) distribution are still being studied.
