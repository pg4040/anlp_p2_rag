"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Research on torsional stiffness of flexspline-flexible bearing contact pair in harmonic drive based on macro-micro scale modeling""?","The flexspline and flexible bearing constitute a critical contact pair in a harmonic drive system, and their torsional stiffness has a significant impact on the performance characteristics manifested by the harmonic drive. In this study, a micro scale three-dimensional fractal model was combined with a macro scale finite element simulation method to establish an equivalent torsional stiffness model for the flexspline-flexible bearing contact pair (FS-FB contact pair), which enables the theoretical prediction of the torsional stiffness of this contact pair. A torsional stiffness testing platform was constructed for a harmonic drive, and the consistency between the experimental results of the torsional stiffness curve and the theoretical predictions validates the effectiveness of the proposed model. The influences of torque, installation eccentricity, and deformation coefficient on the torsional stiffness of the FS-FB contact pair were also discussed. The results indicate that the torsional stiffness of the FS-FB contact pair increases nonlinearly with an increase in torque. On the other hand, the torsional stiffness of the FS-FB contact pair decreases with an increase in installation eccentricity, and increases before subsequently decreasing with an increase in deformation coefficient. Moreover, as torque increases, the impact of installation eccentricity and deformation coefficient on the torsional stiffness diminishes. This article provides a theoretical reference for the optimization design and performance enhancement of harmonic drives."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually Augmented RLHF""?","Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are built across modalities and the misalignment between two modalities can result in""hallucination"", generating textual outputs that are not grounded by the multimodal information in context. To address the multimodal misalignment issue, we adapt the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from the text domain to the task of vision-language alignment, where human annotators are asked to compare two responses and pinpoint the more hallucinated one, and the vision-language model is trained to maximize the simulated human rewards. We propose a new alignment algorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF and further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated training data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available human-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our model. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a new evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing hallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves remarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 94% performance level of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the 87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines. We opensource our code, model, data at https://llava-rlhf.github.io."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""La forêt et la faune de Côte d’Ivoire dans une situation alarmante – Synthèse des résultats de l’Inventaire forestier et faunique national""?","La Côte d’Ivoire a engagé début 2019 un inventaire national de ses forêts et de sa faune, accompagné par des enquêtes socio-économiques auprès des agriculteurs. Cet inventaire, déployé sur l’ensemble du territoire, fournit une grande quantité d’informations. Il montre que l’état des forêts et de la faune est fortement dégradé et que les cultures industrielles (cacaoyer, hévéa, palmier à huile dans le sud, anacardier et coton dans le centre et le nord) sont devenues dominantes. La superficie de la forêt en Côte d’Ivoire est estimée en 2020 à 2,97 millions d’hectares, soit 9,2 % de la surface totale du territoire, dont 2,88 millions d’hectares de forêt (dite) naturelle et un peu plus de 92 000 ha de reboisement. Le taux de déforestation moyen annuel depuis 1986 est de 2,8 % (superficie de la forêt en 1986 de 7,85 millions d’hectares). La superficie de la forêt dans les forêts étatiques, dites forêts classées, n’est plus que de 13,3 % alors que la création des forêts classées dans les années 1970 avait pour objectif la préservation et la gestion durable des forêts. La raréfaction, voire la disparition, des essences commerciales ne permet plus de mettre en œuvre une exploitation forestière respectant les critères de gestion durable. Les aires protégées (parcs nationaux, réserves) ne contiennent plus que 32,2 % de forêt. En outre, des transects d’observation de la faune déployés sur tout le territoire ont permis de montrer que la faune commune (aulacode, guib harnaché, lièvre, etc.) est encore bien présente. En revanche, les grands mammifères (antilopes, éléphants, singes) sont cantonnés dans quelques aires protégées et forêts classées avec des tailles de population souvent critiques. Enfin, l’analyse socio-économique montre que les forêts classées sont occupées par une population humaine composée à 50 % d’allogènes, à 28 % d’autochtones et à 22 % d’allochtones : le cacao occupe la plus grande partie des cultures installées majoritairement par les allogènes. Dans le domaine rural, ce sont surtout les autochtones (76 %) qui s’investissent dans l’agriculture (principalement l’anacarde), suivis des allogènes (13 %) et des allochtones (11 %). L’état des écosystèmes forestiers et de leur faune est alarmant, mais des mesures fortes prises rapidement pourraient permettre d’améliorer cette situation au moins dans les secteurs les mieux préservés. La poursuite de campagnes d’inventaire régulières sera un outil essentiel pour mesurer l’impact de ces décisions."

Cowpea is rich in various nutrients such as fibre, protein, iron, potassium and is low in fat and calories. It has been observed that non-Communicable diseases are increasing at a rapid rate in India as well as globally. The need of the hour is to control the rate of diseases through modification in dietary practices. This study has focused on formulation of whole cowpea pod enriched composite flour by including more fibre and various nutrients in the diet. Methods: In the study, composite flour using whole cowpea pod flour, barley husk flour and whole wheat flour was developed. The nutritional characteristics of composite flour and barley husk were analyzed. Storage study with two different packaging materials was also done. Result: The composite flour was found to have good nutritional properties as it contained valuable amount of protein, energy and crude fibre. It was also found that the flour had higher content of iron, magnesium and calcium while barley husk had higher content of manganese. Laminated aluminium pouches found to be more suitable for use as a packaging material."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""How About Kind of Generating Hedges using End-to-End Neural Models?""?","Hedging is a strategy for softening the impact of a statement in conversation. In reducing the strength of an expression, it may help to avoid embarrassment (more technically, “face threat”) to one’s listener. For this reason, it is often found in contexts of instruction, such as tutoring. In this work, we develop a model of hedge generation based on i) fine-tuning state-of-the-art language models trained on human-human tutoring data, followed by ii) reranking to select the candidate that best matches the expected hedging strategy within a candidate pool using a hedge classifier. We apply this method to a natural peer-tutoring corpus containing a significant number of disfluencies, repetitions, and repairs. The results show that generation in this noisy environment is feasible with reranking. By conducting an error analysis for both approaches, we reveal the challenges faced by systems attempting to accomplish both social and task-oriented goals in conversation."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation""?","Robots should exist anywhere humans do: indoors, outdoors, and even unmapped environments. In contrast, the focus of recent advancements in Object Goal Navigation(OGN) has targeted navigating in indoor environments by leveraging spatial and semantic cues that do not generalize outdoors. While these contributions provide valuable insights into indoor scenarios, the broader spectrum of real-world robotic applications often extends to outdoor settings. As we transition to the vast and complex terrains of outdoor environments, new challenges emerge. Unlike the structured layouts found indoors, outdoor environments lack clear spatial delineations and are riddled with inherent semantic ambiguities. Despite this, humans navigate with ease because we can reason about the unseen. We introduce a new task OUTDOOR, a new mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately hallucinate possible futures, and a new computationally aware success metric for pushing research forward in this more complex domain. Additionally, we show impressive results on both a simulated drone and physical quadruped in outdoor environments.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Crossing the Threshold: Idiomatic Machine Translation through Retrieval Augmentation and Loss Weighting""?","Idioms are common in everyday language, but often pose a challenge to translators because their meanings do not follow from the meanings of their parts. Despite significant advances, machine translation systems still struggle to translate idiomatic expressions. We provide a simple characterization of idiomatic translation and related issues. This allows us to conduct a synthetic experiment revealing a tipping point at which transformer-based machine translation models correctly default to idiomatic translations. To expand multilingual resources, we compile a dataset of ~4k natural sentences containing idiomatic expressions in French, Finnish, and Japanese. To improve translation of natural idioms, we introduce two straightforward yet effective techniques: the strategic upweighting of training loss on potentially idiomatic sentences, and using retrieval-augmented models. This not only improves the accuracy of a strong pretrained MT model on idiomatic sentences by up to 13% in absolute accuracy, but also holds potential benefits for non-idiomatic sentences."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Understanding and Mitigating the Label Noise in Pre-training on Downstream Tasks""?","Pre-training on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuning on downstream tasks have become a standard practice in deep learning. However, pre-training data often contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model. This paper aims to understand the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and to mitigate its impact on downstream tasks. More specifically, through extensive experiments of supervised pre-training models on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K and YFCC15M datasets, we demonstrate that while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) transfer performance, where the training and testing data share the same distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing data distribution are different. We empirically verify that the reason behind is noise in pre-training shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a lightweight black-box tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization on both ID and OOD tasks, considering one may not be able to fully fine-tune or even access the pre-trained models. We conduct practical experiments on popular vision and language models that are pre-trained on noisy data for evaluation of our approach. Our analysis and results show the importance of this interesting and novel research direction, which we term Noisy Model Learning."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms""?","Lexical exact-match systems perform text retrieval efficiently with sparse matching signals and fast retrieval through inverted lists, but naturally suffer from the mismatch between lexical surface form and implicit term semantics. This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF). Each CSF pairs a lexical surface form with a context source, and is represented by a lexical form weight and a contextualized semantic vector representation. This framework is able to perform sparse lexicon-based retrieval by learning to represent each query and document as a ""bag-of-CSFs"", simultaneously addressing two key factors in sparse retrieval: vocabulary expansion of surface form and semantic representation of term meaning. At retrieval time, it efficiently matches CSFs through exact-match of learned surface forms, and effectively scores each CSF pair via contextual semantic representations, leading to joint improvement in both term match and term scoring. Multiple experiments show that this approach successfully resolves the main mismatch issues in lexical exact-match retrieval and outperforms state-of-the-art lexical exact-match systems, reaching comparable accuracy as lexical all-to-all soft match systems as an efficient exact-match-based system."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Inchworm‐Like Soft Robot with Multimodal Locomotion Using an Acrylic Stick‐Constrained Dielectric Elastomer Actuator""?","Inchworm‐like robots have been increasingly investigated in recent years. However, most studies have focused on one or several locomotion modes, lacking in terms of inverted climbing, movement with a heavy load, and climbing a vertical plane. Herein, an inchworm‐like soft robot is actuated with multimodal locomotion using an acrylic stick‐constrained dielectric elastomer actuator (ASCDEA). By assembling the ASCDEA with a flexible support frame, a soft saddle‐like shape body is designed to provide the shape deformation ability for the robot. This design enables the robot to move under a heavy load. Two electroadhesion actuators are designed to implement the anchoring action. Additionally, a coordination control strategy is developed to synchronize the shape deformation and electroadhesion for multimodal locomotion. Experimental results confirm that the designed robot can move at a maximum velocity of 39.55 mm s−1 (0.53 body length s−1) on an inverted plane. Moreover, the robot is capable of multimodal locomotion, including inverted climbing, vertical climbing, horizontal crawling, turning locomotion, and rapid movement with a heavy load. The developed soft robot can navigate through a confined horizontal tunnel while carrying a payload, cross a gap, circumvent obstacles, and is particularly robust owing to its compliance."

We investigate the extent of LLMs' N-ToM through an extensive evaluation on 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM abilities, this behavior is far from being robust. We further examine the factors impacting performance on N-ToM tasks and discover that LLMs struggle with adversarial examples, indicating reliance on shallow heuristics rather than robust ToM abilities. We caution against drawing conclusions from anecdotal examples, limited benchmark testing, and using human-designed psychological tests to evaluate models."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""491. Risk Factors for Severe Pediatric COVID-19: A Systematic Review""?","Abstract Background Optimal management of COVID-19 in children requires risk stratification based on comorbidities and demographic factors that can predispose to severe disease. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) Pediatric COVID-19 Therapies Task Force, comprised of pediatric infectious diseases physicians, intensivists, and pharmacists from 29 US hospitals, develops clinical guidance for pediatric COVID-19 management. In support of these efforts, a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature was conducted to synthesize the evidence for risk factors for severe pediatric COVID-19. Methods Medline, EMBASE, and CDC databases were searched to identify all relevant publications before July 1, 2022. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify studies that assessed for potential predictors of severe COVID-19 disease in children < 21 years. Severe disease was defined by intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, multiorgan dysfunction, or death. A team of reviewers appraised eligible studies, extracted relevant data, and assessed the quality of evidence. Comorbidities and demographic factors were classified as definite, probable, or unlikely risk factors based on the certainty of association with severe COVID-19. Results Sixteen potential risk factors were evaluated based on evidence from 50 studies: 13 reviews/meta-analyses, 23 multi-center, and 14 single-center studies (Figure 1). Severe immunocompromise, obesity, diabetes, prematurity, and neurologic, cardiovascular, and chronic lung disease were classified as definite risk factors. Evidence was less consistent in support of sickle cell disease, mild/moderate immunocompromise, neurodevelopmental, and chronic liver disorders as risk factors. Most studies found asthma, sex, mental health, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory bowel disease to be unlikely risk factors. Many studies demonstrated that the magnitude of risk for comorbidities was modified by prior immunization, age, and medical complexity (i.e., multiple or poorly controlled comorbidities) (Figure 2).Figure 1. Evidence Review: Comorbidities and Severe COVID-19 in Children Obesity - BMI ≥95th percentile for age and sex per CDC growth curves. Severe immunocompromise - Any of the following: Receipt in the 3 months before COVID-19 diagnosis of chemotherapy for a solid tumor or hematologic malignancy, high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone >20mg/day for ≥14 days), or other systemic B- or T-cell-depleting immunosuppressive agents; hematopoietic stem cell transplant, CAR T cell therapy, or solid organ transplant within 100 days of COVID-19 diagnosis; human immunodeficiency virus infection and CD4 count <200; combined primary immunodeficiency disorders. Moderate immunocompromise - Routine receipt of non-lymphocyte-depleting immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications or prednisone <20 mg/day for inflammatory/immune-mediated disease.Figure 2. Risk Factors and Risk Modifiers for Severe Pediatric COVID-19 *Children who are less likely to gain protection from previous infections or vaccines. Definite risk factor - Evidence for increased risk for severe COVID-19, supported by large multicenter studies, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews. Probable risk factor - Evidence for increased risk, supported by small or single-center studies; this category also includes factors inconsistently associated with severe COVID-19, suggesting substantial uncertainty. Unlikely risk factor - Evidence against increased risk for severe COVID-19, supported by large multicenter studies, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews. Conclusion This study highlights key comorbidities and effect modifiers associated with severe COVID-19 in children. These findings can be used to facilitate risk stratification and inform management decisions. Disclosures Zachary I.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Incremental Blockwise Beam Search for Simultaneous Speech Translation with Controllable Quality-Latency Tradeoff""?","Blockwise self-attentional encoder models have recently emerged as one promising end-to-end approach to simultaneous speech translation. These models employ a blockwise beam search with hypothesis reliability scoring to determine when to wait for more input speech before translating further. However, this method maintains multiple hypotheses until the entire speech input is consumed -- this scheme cannot directly show a single \textit{incremental} translation to users. Further, this method lacks mechanisms for \textit{controlling} the quality vs. latency tradeoff. We propose a modified incremental blockwise beam search incorporating local agreement or hold-$n$ policies for quality-latency control. We apply our framework to models trained for online or offline translation and demonstrate that both types can be effectively used in online mode. Experimental results on MuST-C show 0.6-3.6 BLEU improvement without changing latency or 0.8-1.4 s latency improvement without changing quality."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""It’s MBR All the Way Down: Modern Generation Techniques Through the Lens of Minimum Bayes Risk""?","Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding is a method for choosing the outputs of a machine learning system based not on the output with the highest probability, but the output with the lowest risk (expected error) among multiple candidates. It is a simple but powerful method: for an additional cost at inference time, MBR provides reliable several-point improvements across metrics for a wide variety of tasks without any additional data or training. Despite this, MBR is not frequently applied in NLP works, and knowledge of the method itself is limited. We first provide an introduction to the method and the recent literature. We show that several recent methods that do not reference MBR can be written as special cases of MBR; this reformulation provides additional theoretical justification for the performance of these methods, explaining some results that were previously only empirical. We provide theoretical and empirical results about the effectiveness of various MBR variants and make concrete recommendations for the application of MBR in NLP models, including future directions in this area."

Both the asymmetry ratio, R=(I(5_(D_0 )-7_(F_2 )))/(I(5_(D_0 )-7_(F_1 ))), and the Judd-Ofelt 2 intensity parameter increases in the order YPO4 < YAsO4 < YVO4. This correlation is interpreted qualitatively in terms of the covalency and polarizability of (XO4)3-, which increases in the order (PO4)3- < (AsO4)3- < (VO4)3-. The trend is supported by the results of electronic band structure calculations of the three compounds which establish the strength of hybridization between the X cation and the oxygen 2p states. The electronic structure of YAsO4 is calculated to probe the covalence of As-O bonding. The increasing oscillator strength of the Eu3+ 5D07F2 transition in going from YPO4 to YAsO4 to YVO4 is consistent with the expectation of ligand dipolar polarization model for hypersensitivity which states that the oscillator strength of the 5D07F2 transition is proportional to the square of the ligand dipolar polarizability. The connection between the mechanism of hypersensitivity and second harmonic generation (SHG) is presented."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Evaluating Speech Synthesis by Training Recognizers on Synthetic Speech""?","Modern speech synthesis systems have improved significantly, with synthetic speech being indistinguishable from real speech. However, efficient and holistic evaluation of synthetic speech still remains a significant challenge. Human evaluation using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is ideal, but inefficient due to high costs. Therefore, researchers have developed auxiliary automatic metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to measure intelligibility. Prior works focus on evaluating synthetic speech based on pre-trained speech recognition models, however, this can be limiting since this approach primarily measures speech intelligibility. In this paper, we propose an evaluation technique involving the training of an ASR model on synthetic speech and assessing its performance on real speech. Our main assumption is that by training the ASR model on the synthetic speech, the WER on real speech reflects the similarity between distributions, a broader assessment of synthetic speech quality beyond intelligibility. Our proposed metric demonstrates a strong correlation with both MOS naturalness and MOS intelligibility when compared to SpeechLMScore and MOSNet on three recent Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems: MQTTS, StyleTTS, and YourTTS."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""2945. Audit and Feedback Informed ASP Interventions Lead to Sustained Reductions in Suboptimal Antibiotic Prescribing at Hospital Discharge""?","Abstract Background Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have traditionally focused on the inpatient setting; however, a significant proportion of antibiotics initiated during hospital stays are continued at the time of discharge. Previous studies have found that rates of suboptimal antibiotic prescribing at the time of hospital discharge may be as high as 30%. Our study aimed to implement ASP interventions targeted at reducing suboptimal prescribing at the time of hospital discharge and to assess the effectiveness and durability of these interventions over time. Methods Beginning 11/2020, our ASP began audit and feedback of both enteral and parenteral hospital discharge antibiotic prescriptions. A prescription was determined to be suboptimal if the dose, frequency, duration, selection, or formulation were inconsistent with institutional and/or national guidelines or based on the clinical judgment of the ASP pharmacist. Findings from this process were used to develop interventions, including targeted provider and medical service education, institutional guideline development, and electronic health record modifications. The rate of suboptimal discharge antibiotic prescribing from 12/2020-4/2023 was plotted on a statistical process p-chart, including a historical baseline (9/2020-10/2020). Results A total of 4347 prescription audits were performed over a 28-month period and included 4211 enteral and 136 parenteral antibiotics. Reasons prescriptions were identified as suboptimal are included in Figure 1. A p-chart (Figure 2) identified a decline in suboptimal prescribing from a baseline rate of 29% to 15% after implementation of audit and feedback, modification of medication order entry panels, and targeted interventions to surgical services. After implementation of all interventions (Table 1), a centerline shift was detected, with a decrease in suboptimal prescribing from 15% to 8%. Figure 1. Reasons discharge prescriptions were identified as suboptimal (N=568). A prescription may have more than one reason for being considered suboptimal. Figure 2. Suboptimal Antibiotic Prescriptions at Hospital Discharge, 2020 – 2023: P-chart for suboptimal prescription rate. The yellow line indicates mean suboptimal prescription percentage for the study period (15% and 8%, respectively). The purple dashed line indicates literature reported rate of suboptimal prescribing (30%). Interventions annotated 1-7 within figure are found in Table 1. LCL, lower control limit; UCL, upper control limit. Conclusion Suboptimal antibiotic prescribing rates decreased by 72% over a 2.5-year period through a mix of audit with feedback and targeted interventions. These new processes may demonstrate a potentially effective sustained reduction in suboptimal prescribing. ASPs should consider implementation of hospital discharge prescription review as part of ambulatory stewardship efforts. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures"

In this paper, we provide the first critical review of literature surrounding the integration of open and reproducible scholarship into teaching and learning and its associated outcomes in students.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Evaluating Picture Description Speech for Dementia Detection using Image-text Alignment""?","Using picture description speech for dementia detection has been studied for 30 years. Despite the long history, previous models focus on identifying the differences in speech patterns between healthy subjects and patients with dementia but do not utilize the picture information directly. In this paper, we propose the first dementia detection models that take both the picture and the description texts as inputs and incorporate knowledge from large pre-trained image-text alignment models. We observe the difference between dementia and healthy samples in terms of the text's relevance to the picture and the focused area of the picture. We thus consider such a difference could be used to enhance dementia detection accuracy. Specifically, we use the text's relevance to the picture to rank and filter the sentences of the samples. We also identified focused areas of the picture as topics and categorized the sentences according to the focused areas. We propose three advanced models that pre-processed the samples based on their relevance to the picture, sub-image, and focused areas. The evaluation results show that our advanced models, with knowledge of the picture and large image-text alignment models, achieve state-of-the-art performance with the best detection accuracy at 83.44%, which is higher than the text-only baseline model at 79.91%. Lastly, we visualize the sample and picture results to explain the advantages of our models."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Using citizen science to protect threatened amphibian populations in urban spaces: ecology, life history, and conservation of green toads and fire salamanders in Jerusalem and Haifa""?","The rapid urbanization processes occurring worldwide are amongst the main factors driving the current biodiversity crisis. In particular, a third of known amphibian species are directly threatened by urbanization. The negation of this threat will require conservation efforts aimed at sustaining viable amphibian populations within the urban landscape, which must be informed by a deep understanding of the way amphibian populations are affected by the unique risk factors of the urban environment. To address this need for four populations of amphibians in Israel, we performed a capture-recapture analysis on two datasets. The larger of the two datasets is the result of a multi-year citizen science program focused on two Salamandra infraimmaculata populations within the city of Haifa, Israel. The second dataset is the result of one year of survey following a similar protocol that we performed on two Bufotes variabilis populations within the city of Jerusalem and at a nature reserve near it. Individuals of both species have unique and recognizable dorsal spot patterns, which allowed for noninvasive recapture identification. The results of our analysis provide insights that can guide future conservation of the specific studied population, but our conclusions have wider implications, regarding both the ecology of the studied species and applied conservation science: using the salamander dataset, we developed a method of length-based age estimations for this species and found that the studied salamanders have a prolonged period of increased vulnerability throughout their first years of life, even after reaching sexual maturity. Additionally, the shared conclusions from the two case studies indicate that the creation of fish-containing artificial water bodies in Mediterranean habitats can have detrimental impacts on the resident amphibian populations. Synthesis and implications: The significance and extent of our results demonstrate the effectiveness of citizen science as a tool for research and conservation in the urban environment. Our findings call for the implementation of management practices that prioritize the protection of urban amphibians and their habitats. By identifying the vulnerability of amphibians during critical life stages and highlighting the negative impacts of fish-containing water bodies, our study contributes to the development of informed conservation policies with implications for urban planning, habitat management, and biodiversity conservation strategies."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Protecting Language Generation Models via Invisible Watermarking""?","Language generation models have been an increasingly powerful enabler for many applications. Many such models offer free or affordable API access, which makes them potentially vulnerable to model extraction attacks through distillation. To protect intellectual property (IP) and ensure fair use of these models, various techniques such as lexical watermarking and synonym replacement have been proposed. However, these methods can be nullified by obvious countermeasures such as""synonym randomization"". To address this issue, we propose GINSEW, a novel method to protect text generation models from being stolen through distillation. The key idea of our method is to inject secret signals into the probability vector of the decoding steps for each target token. We can then detect the secret message by probing a suspect model to tell if it is distilled from the protected one. Experimental results show that GINSEW can effectively identify instances of IP infringement with minimal impact on the generation quality of protected APIs. Our method demonstrates an absolute improvement of 19 to 29 points on mean average precision (mAP) in detecting suspects compared to previous methods against watermark removal attacks."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Fairness Through Domain Awareness: Mitigating Popularity Bias For Music Discovery""?","As online music platforms grow, music recommender systems play a vital role in helping users navigate and discover content within their vast musical databases. At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias, which causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially more relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic relationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this issue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which addresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender systems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth listening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should be reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful music discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music domain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing recommendations at both the playlist level and user level. Then, we ground our evaluation in the cold start setting, showing that our approach outperforms existing fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of lesser-known content. Finally, our analysis explains why our proposed methodology is a novel and promising approach to mitigating popularity bias and improving the discovery of new and niche content in music recommender systems."

This shift toward broadly available but less accurate captioning invites exploration of the role hearing conversation partners play in shaping the accessibility of a conversation to d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) captioning users. While recent work has explored DHH individuals’ videoconferencing experiences with captioning, we focus on established groups’ current practices and priorities for future tools to support more accessible online conversations. Our study consists of three codesign sessions, conducted with four groups (17 participants total, 10 DHH, 7 hearing). We found that established groups crafted social accessibility norms that met their relational contexts. We also identify promising directions for future captioning design, including the need to standardize speaker identification and customization, opportunities to provide behavioral feedback during a conversation, and ways that videoconferencing platforms could enable groups to set and share norms."

It is one of the widely expressed tight junctional claudins with functions not well defined. In the present study, the expression profile and its role in cerebral endothelial cells and in the interaction between breast cancer and endothelial cells were investigated. Materials and Methods: CLDN10 expression was examined in a wide range of cell types. Brain endothelial cell models with or without CLDN10 expression were generated using the hCMEC/D3 cell line and used to test the barrier and permeability functions. Transendothelial drug delivery and invasion were also evaluated. Results: hCMEC/D3 cells express high levels of CLDN10, compared with peripheral endothelial cells, mesothelial cells, fibroblasts, and breast cancer cells, which were either negative or expressed low levels of CLDN10. Knockdown of CLDN10 in hCMEC/D3 cells resulted in impaired tight junctions as seen by reduced transendothelial electric resistance and paracellular permeability. It also accelerated invasion of breast cancer cells through the endothelial cell layer. CLDN10 knockdown in hCMEC/D3 cells led to an increase in transendothelial chemodrug delivery. Furthermore, the SRC kinase inhibitor (AZM475271) was able to decrease the impedance and increase the paracellular permeability in cerebral endothelial cells. Conclusion: Cerebral endothelial cells express high levels of CLDN10, a protein regulating barrier function and thereby drug permeability and cancer invasiveness in brain endothelial cells, suggesting that it is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of brain metastasis-related diseases."

As various interventions have been developed to manage it, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of pharmaceutical interventions on outcomes of PIMs in older patients. Methods Meta-analysis of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to report the outcomes of pharmaceutical interventions in older patients searching from the databases of Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, SinoMed and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR). The PRISMA guidelines were followed and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019134754). Cochrane bias risk assessment tool and the modified Jadad scale were used to assess the risk bias. RevMan software was used for data processing, analysis and graphical plotting. Results Sixty-five thousand, nine hundred seventy-one patients in 14 RCTs were included. Of the primary outcomes, pharmaceutical interventions could significantly reduce the incidence of PIMs in older patients (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.62; p < 0.001), and the number of PIMs per person (MD = -0.41, 95%CI: −0.51, −0.31; p < 0.001), accompanying by a low heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis showed that the application of computer-based clinical decision support for pharmacological interventions could remarkably decrease the incidence of PIMs and two assessment tools were more effective. Of the secondary outcomes, the meta-analysis showed that pharmacological interventions could reduce the number of drugs used per person (MD = -0.94, 95%CI: −1.51, −0.36; p = 0.001) and 30-day readmission rate (OR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.36, 0.92; p = 0.02), accompanying by a low heterogeneity. However, the pharmaceutical interventions demonstrated no significant improvement on all-cause mortality and the number of falls. Conclusion Our findings supported the efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions to optimize the use and management of drugs in older patients.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""MCM6 is a Poor Prognostic Biomarker and Promotes Progression in Breast Cancer.""?","BACKGROUND Breast cancer is the commonest global malignancy and the primary cause of carcinoma death. MCM6 is vital to carcinogenesis, but the pathogenesis of MCM6 remains unclear. METHODS MCM6 expression in patients with breast cancer was examined through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, immunohistochemistry, Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT‒PCR) and Western blotting. The prognostic factors were assessed by the Kaplan‒Meier method and Cox regression. On the basis of the key factors selected by multivariable Cox regression analysis, a nomogram risk prediction model was adopted for clinical risk assessment. The TCGA database was utilized to determine how MCM6 is correlated with chemotherapy sensitivity, immune checkpoint-related genes (ICGs), tumor-infiltrating immune cells, along with tumor mutation burden (TMB) and methylation. The impact of MCM6 on carcinoma cells was investigated in terms of proliferation, cell cycle as well as migrating and invasive behavior through CCK assays, flow cytometry, wound healing assays, Transwell assays and xenotransplantation experiments. RESULTS MCM6 expression was upregulated, which is closely associated with the size of the tumor (p = 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.012) in patients with breast cancer. Multivariate analysis revealed MCM6 to be an independent risk factor for prognosis in patients with breast carcinoma. The nomograph prediction model included MCM6, age, ER, M and N stage, which displayed good discrimination with a C index of 0.817 and good calibration. Overexpression of MCM6 correlated with chemotherapy sensitivity, immune checkpoint-related genes (ICGs), tumor-infiltrating immune cells, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and methylation. Silencing MCM6 significantly inhibited proliferation, prolonged the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and restrained the proliferation, migration and invasive behavior of cancerous cells and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS Our research shows that MCM6 is highly expressed in breast cancer and can be used as an independent prognostic factor, which is expected to become a new target for the treatment of breast cancer in the future."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical""?","Despite its flexibility to learn diverse inductive biases in machine learning programs, meta learning (i.e., learning to learn) has long been recognized to suffer from poor scalability due to its tremendous compute/memory costs, training instability, and a lack of efficient distributed training support. In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show that SAMA-based data optimization leads to consistent improvements in text classification accuracy with BERT and RoBERTa large language models, and achieves state-of-the-art results in both small- and large-scale data pruning on image classification tasks, demonstrating the practical applicability of scalable meta learning across language and vision domains."

Then, we estimated the incidence trend of varicella through interrupted time-series analyses and quantified the impact of the immunization program and PHSMs using Serfling regression. We also explored the associations between PHSMs and varicella cases. The implementation of the two-dose VarV strategy was followed by a significant decrease in varicella incidence (−1.84% per month). After one year of the program, varicella incidence was estimated at a 45.25% reduction, which was higher in children (59.12% and 54.09%) than in adults (19.49%). The decrease attributed to PHSMs was 31.26% during 2020–2022, and school closing was identified as the most relevant PHSM (b = −8.03 cases, r = −0.67 with a 1-week lag). These findings indicate that the two-dose immunization program has more effectively reduced the varicella incidence compared with the one-dose vaccine, and interventions like school closings are also encouraged to serve as supplementary measures to prevent varicella epidemics."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Combining Spatiotemporally Global and Local Interpolations Improves Modeling of Annual Land Surface Temperature Cycles""?","Annual temperature cycle (ATC) models are widely used to characterize temporally continuous land surface temperature (LST) dynamics within an annual cycle. However, the existing ATC models ignore the spatiotemporally local correlations among adjacent LST pixels and are inadequate for capturing the complex relationships between LSTs and LST-related descriptors. To address these issues, we propose an improved ATC model (termed the ATC_GL), which combines both the spatiotemporally global and local interpolations. Using the random forest (RF) algorithm, the ATC_GL model quantifies the complex relationships between LSTs and LST-related descriptors such as the surface air temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, and digital elevation model. The performances of the ATC_GL and several extensively used LST reconstruction methods were compared under both clear-sky and overcast conditions. In the scenario with randomly missing LSTs, the accuracy of the ATC_GL was 2.3 K and 3.1 K higher than that of the ATCE (the enhanced ATC model) and the ATCO (the original ATC model), respectively. In the scenario with LST gaps of various sizes, the ATC_GL maintained the highest accuracy and was less sensitive to gap size when compared with the ATCH (the hybrid ATC model), Kriging interpolation, RSDAST (Remotely Sensed Daily Land Surface Temperature), and HIT (Hybrid Interpolation Technique). In the scenario of overcast conditions, the accuracy of the ATC_GL was 1.0 K higher than that of other LST reconstruction methods. The ATC_GL enriches the ATC model family and provides enhanced performance for generating spatiotemporally seamless LST products with high accuracy."

This paper broadens the current scope of neural solvers for NPC problems by introducing a new graph-based diffusion framework, namely DIFUSCO. Our framework casts NPC problems as discrete {0, 1}-vector optimization problems and leverages graph-based denoising diffusion models to generate high-quality solutions. We investigate two types of diffusion models with Gaussian and Bernoulli noise, respectively, and devise an effective inference schedule to enhance the solution quality. We evaluate our methods on two well-studied NPC combinatorial optimization problems: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS). Experimental results show that DIFUSCO strongly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solvers, improving the performance gap between ground-truth and neural solvers from 1.76% to 0.46% on TSP-500, from 2.46% to 1.17% on TSP-1000, and from 3.19% to 2.58% on TSP10000.

Our experiments suggest that models show only limited consistency between factual beliefs, but update methods can both fix incorrect model beliefs and greatly improve their consistency.

However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Memory-adaptive Depth-wise Heterogenous Federated Learning""?","Federated learning is a promising paradigm that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing the local data. However, the presence of heterogeneous devices in federated learning, such as mobile phones and IoT devices with varying memory capabilities, would limit the scale and hence the performance of the model could be trained. The mainstream approaches to address memory limitations focus on width-slimming techniques, where different clients train subnetworks with reduced widths locally and then the server aggregates the subnetworks. The global model produced from these methods suffers from performance degradation due to the negative impact of the actions taken to handle the varying subnetwork widths in the aggregation phase. In this paper, we introduce a memory-adaptive depth-wise learning solution in FL called FeDepth, which adaptively decomposes the full model into blocks according to the memory budgets of each client and trains blocks sequentially to obtain a full inference model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 5% and more than 10% improvements in top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of depth-wise fine-tuning on ViT.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Evaluating Speech Synthesis by Training Recognizers on Synthetic Speech""?","Modern speech synthesis systems have improved significantly, with synthetic speech being indistinguishable from real speech. However, efficient and holistic evaluation of synthetic speech still remains a significant challenge. Human evaluation using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is ideal, but inefficient due to high costs. Therefore, researchers have developed auxiliary automatic metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to measure intelligibility. Prior works focus on evaluating synthetic speech based on pre-trained speech recognition models, however, this can be limiting since this approach primarily measures speech intelligibility. In this paper, we propose an evaluation technique involving the training of an ASR model on synthetic speech and assessing its performance on real speech. Our main assumption is that by training the ASR model on the synthetic speech, the WER on real speech reflects the similarity between distributions, a broader assessment of synthetic speech quality beyond intelligibility. Our proposed metric demonstrates a strong correlation with both MOS naturalness and MOS intelligibility when compared to SpeechLMScore and MOSNet on three recent Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems: MQTTS, StyleTTS, and YourTTS."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Recent Advances in Decellularized Extracellular Matrix-Based Bioinks for 3D Bioprinting in Tissue Engineering""?","In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has been widely utilized as a novel manufacturing technique by more and more researchers to construct various tissue substitutes with complex architectures and geometries. Different biomaterials, including natural and synthetic materials, have been manufactured into bioinks for tissue regeneration using 3D bioprinting. Among the natural biomaterials derived from various natural tissues or organs, the decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) has a complex internal structure and a variety of bioactive factors that provide mechanistic, biophysical, and biochemical signals for tissue regeneration and remodeling. In recent years, more and more researchers have been developing the dECM as a novel bioink for the construction of tissue substitutes. Compared with other bioinks, the various ECM components in dECM-based bioink can regulate cellular functions, modulate the tissue regeneration process, and adjust tissue remodeling. Therefore, we conducted this review to discuss the current status of and perspectives on dECM-based bioinks for bioprinting in tissue engineering. In addition, the various bioprinting techniques and decellularization methods were also discussed in this study."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Beyond Active Engagement: The Significance of Lurkers in a Polarized Twitter Debate""?","The emergence of new public forums in the shape of online social media has introduced unprecedented challenges to public discourse, including polarization, misinformation, and the emergence of echo chambers. While existing research has extensively studied the behavior of active users within echo chambers, little attention has been given to the hidden audience, also known as lurkers, who passively consume content without actively engaging. This study aims to estimate the share of the hidden audience and investigate their interplay with the echo chamber effect. Using Twitter as a case study, we analyze a polarized political debate to understand the engagement patterns and factors influencing the hidden audience's presence. Our findings reveal a relevant fraction of users that consume content without active interaction, which underscores the importance of considering their presence in online debates. Notably, our results indicate that the engagement of the hidden audience is primarily influenced by factors such as the reliability of media sources mentioned in tweets rather than the ideological stance of the user that produced the content. These findings highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the hidden audience's role in online debates and how they may influence public opinion."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""PAMR1 negatively impacts cell proliferation and migration of Human Colon Cancer HT29 Cell Line""?","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is becoming one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. Among cancers, it ranks the third place in terms of incidence and the second in terms of mortality. Even though immunological test allows fast and easy diagnostic method, there is no specific and reliable methods for early detection of CRC. Despite different treatments, high risk of re-occurrence is associated with advanced and metastatic CRC stages. An exhaustive knowledge on specific biomarkers or molecular actors involved in CRC could help to eradicate tumors or limit cancer recurrence. In this study, we focused on PAMR1 (Peptidase Domain Containing Associated with Muscle Regeneration 1), which is already considered as a tumor suppressor in breast and cervical cancers. In silico analysis of RNASeq data showed that PAMR1 was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues compared to their adjacent normal ones, as well as in cervical cancer. Our analysis showed that this downregulation, probably due to promoter hypermethylation, such as in breast cancer tissues, appeared in the four cancer stages as early as the first stage. In consistency with in silico analyses, the expression of PAMR1 was found to be lower at the transcript and protein levels in CRC tissue samples compared to normal ones, as well as in different CRC cell lines (HCT116, HT29, and SW620) compared to normal colon cell line (CCD841CoN). To understand the role of PAMR1 in CRC cancer, recombinant purified PAMR1 or concentrated secretome from CHO overexpressing PAMR1 were used to exogenously treat CRC cell lines with a focus on HT-29 cells as well as Hela cervical cancer cell line known to be sensitive to PAMR1. Transient or stable transfections were also performed to determine the impact of PAMR1 overexpression in HT29 and/or HeLa cells. In this study, we finally showed that presence of PAMR1 could reduce both cell proliferation and cell migration with a positive correlation between these biological effects and PAMR1’s quantity. This implies that PAMR1 expresses anti-proliferative and anti-migrative effects in CRC. Further studies to be done in order to confirm the tumor suppressive role of PAMR1 in CRC."

The articulatory space is a promising inversion target, since this space captures the mechanics of speech production. To this end, we build an acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) model that leverages autoregression, adversarial training, and self supervision to generalize to unseen speakers. Our approach obtains 0.784 correlation on an electromagnetic articulography (EMA) dataset, improving the state-of-the-art by 12.5%. Additionally, we show the interpretability of these representations through directly com-paring the behavior of estimated representations with speech production behavior. Finally, we propose a resynthesis-based AAI evaluation metric that does not rely on articulatory labels, demonstrating its efficacy with an 18-speaker dataset."

Datasets have been created in English to accelerate progress towards measuring and improving figurative language processing in language models (LMs). However, the use of figurative language is an expression of our cultural and societal experiences, making it difficult for these phrases to be universally applicable. In this work, we create a figurative language inference dataset, \datasetname, for seven diverse languages associated with a variety of cultures: Hindi, Indonesian, Javanese, Kannada, Sundanese, Swahili and Yoruba. Our dataset reveals that each language relies on cultural and regional concepts for figurative expressions, with the highest overlap between languages originating from the same region. We assess multilingual LMs' abilities to interpret figurative language in zero-shot and few-shot settings. All languages exhibit a significant deficiency compared to English, with variations in performance reflecting the availability of pre-training and fine-tuning data, emphasizing the need for LMs to be exposed to a broader range of linguistic and cultural variation during training."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""MOSAIC: Learning Unified Multi-Sensory Object Property Representations for Robot Perception""?","A holistic understanding of object properties across diverse sensory modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and haptic) is essential for tasks ranging from object categorization to complex manipulation. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science studies that emphasize the significance of multi-sensory integration in human perception, we introduce MOSAIC (Multimodal Object property learning with Self-Attention and Interactive Comprehension), a novel framework designed to facilitate the learning of unified multi-sensory object property representations. While it is undeniable that visual information plays a prominent role, we acknowledge that many fundamental object properties extend beyond the visual domain to encompass attributes like texture, mass distribution, or sounds, which significantly influence how we interact with objects. In MOSAIC, we leverage this profound insight by distilling knowledge from multimodal foundation models and aligning these representations not only across vision but also haptic and auditory sensory modalities. Through extensive experiments on a dataset where a humanoid robot interacts with 100 objects across 10 exploratory behaviors, we demonstrate the versatility of MOSAIC in two task families: object categorization and object-fetching tasks. Our results underscore the efficacy of MOSAIC's unified representations, showing competitive performance in category recognition through a simple linear probe setup and excelling in the fetch object task under zero-shot transfer conditions. This work pioneers the application of sensory grounding in foundation models for robotics, promising a significant leap in multi-sensory perception capabilities for autonomous systems.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Sea Level Rise Effects on the Sedimentary Dynamics of the Douro Estuary Sandspit (Portugal)""?","Sandspits are important natural defences against the effects of storm events in estuarine regions, and their temporal and spatial dynamics are related to river flow, wave energy, and wind action. Understanding the impact of extreme wave events on the morphodynamics of these structures for current conditions and future projections is of paramount importance to promote coastal and navigation safety. In this work, a numerical analysis of the impact of a storm on the sandspit of the Douro estuary (NW Portugal) was carried out considering several mean sea level conditions induced by climate change. The selected numerical models were SWAN, for hydrodynamics, and XBeach, for hydrodynamic and morphodynamic assessments. The extreme event selected for this study was based on the meteo-oceanic conditions recorded during Hurricane Christina (January 2014), which caused significant damage on the western Portuguese coast. The analysis focused on the short-term (two days) impact of the storm on the morphodynamics of the sandspit in terms of its erosion and accretion patterns. The obtained results demonstrate that the mean sea level rise will induce some increase in the erosion/accretion volumes on the seaward side of the sandspit. Overtopping of the detached breakwater and the possibility of wave overtopping of the sandspit crest were observed for the highest simulated mean sea levels."

We then spell out what requirements for chatbots follow from these forms of appropriateness to avoid the limits of previous accounts: positionality, acceptability, and value alignment (PAVA).

In recent decades, this species has spread rapidly to temperate regions. Phenotypic plasticity and climate warming are thought to promote the worldwide dispersion of R. raciborskii. However, investigations into the genetic and phenotypic diversities of this species have revealed significant intraspecific heterogeneity. In particular, competition between R. raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa was highly strain dependent. Although the concept of an ecotype was proposed to explain the heterogeneity of R. raciborskii strains with different geographic origins, microevolution is more reasonable for understanding the coexistence of different phenotypes and genotypes in the same environment. It has been suggested that intraspecific heterogeneity derived from microevolution is a strong driving force for the expansion of R. raciborskii. Additionally, temperature, nutrient fluctuations, and grazer disturbance are critical environmental factors that affect the population establishment of R. raciborskii in new environments. The present review provides new insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying the invasion of R. raciborskii in Chinese freshwater ecosystems."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Fairness Continual Learning Approach to Semantic Scene Understanding in Open-World Environments""?","Continual semantic segmentation aims to learn new classes while maintaining the information from the previous classes. Although prior studies have shown impressive progress in recent years, the fairness concern in the continual semantic segmentation needs to be better addressed. Meanwhile, fairness is one of the most vital factors in deploying the deep learning model, especially in human-related or safety applications. In this paper, we present a novel Fairness Continual Learning approach to the semantic segmentation problem. In particular, under the fairness objective, a new fairness continual learning framework is proposed based on class distributions. Then, a novel Prototypical Contrastive Clustering loss is proposed to address the significant challenges in continual learning, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and background shift.

In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show that SAMA-based data optimization leads to consistent improvements in text classification accuracy with BERT and RoBERTa large language models, and achieves state-of-the-art results in both small- and large-scale data pruning on image classification tasks, demonstrating the practical applicability of scalable meta learning across language and vision domains."

This necessitates not only an interpretable model but also interpretable features. In particular, language must be featurized in a way that is interpretable while still characterizing the original text well. We present SenteCon, a method for introducing human interpretability in deep language representations. Given a passage of text, SenteCon encodes the text as a layer of interpretable categories in which each dimension corresponds to the relevance of a specific category. Our empirical evaluations indicate that encoding language with SenteCon provides high-level interpretability at little to no cost to predictive performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, we find that SenteCon outperforms existing interpretable language representations with respect to both its downstream performance and its agreement with human characterizations of the text."

First, the original data are denoised using complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise and the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm. Second, the noise-reduced data are plotted as mean spectrogram bar graphs, and the datasets are divided. Third, the training set graphs are input into the ResNet-50 network to train the base model for fault diagnosis. Fourth, all the layers of the base model are frozen, except for the fully connected and softmax layers, and the support set graphs are used to train the base model through transfer learning. Finally, a fault diagnosis model is obtained. The model is tested using data from two test pumps, resulting in accuracies of 86.1% and 90.8% and providing evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method for diagnosing faults in hydraulic plunger pumps."

In particular, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are reportedly important for muscle strength in nursing home residents. However, the effects of MCFAs on healthy adults at risk for frailty remain unknown. Hence, a randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) intake and walking on muscle mass and function in healthy, sedentary, middle-aged and older adults with a low body mass index. Three MCT intake groups with different amounts of octanoic and decanoic acid intake were compared with a control group. After 12 weeks, knee extension strength increased in all groups, with the increases in all MCT intake groups being significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Grip strength significantly increased from baseline in the MCT 6 g/day intake group (p < 0.05). The combination of aerobic exercise and MCT intake may be effective in preventing decline in muscle strength and promoting increase in muscle strength as they can improve muscle energy production, thereby contributing to the maintenance of good health for middle-aged and older adults at high risk for frailty and sarcopenia."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Efficiency Pentathlon: A Standardized Arena for Efficiency Evaluation""?","Rising computational demands of modern natural language processing (NLP) systems have increased the barrier to entry for cutting-edge research while posing serious environmental concerns. Yet, progress on model efficiency has been impeded by practical challenges in model evaluation and comparison. For example, hardware is challenging to control due to disparate levels of accessibility across different institutions. Moreover, improvements in metrics such as FLOPs often fail to translate to progress in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Pentathlon, a benchmark for holistic and realistic evaluation of model efficiency. Pentathlon focuses on inference, which accounts for a majority of the compute in a model's lifecycle. It offers a strictly-controlled hardware platform, and is designed to mirror real-world applications scenarios. It incorporates a suite of metrics that target different aspects of efficiency, including latency, throughput, memory overhead, and energy consumption. Pentathlon also comes with a software library that can be seamlessly integrated into any codebase and enable evaluation. As a standardized and centralized evaluation platform, Pentathlon can drastically reduce the workload to make fair and reproducible efficiency comparisons. While initially focused on natural language processing (NLP) models, Pentathlon is designed to allow flexible extension to other fields. We envision Pentathlon will stimulate algorithmic innovations in building efficient models, and foster an increased awareness of the social and environmental implications in the development of future-generation NLP models."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Principle-Driven Self-Alignment of Language Models from Scratch with Minimal Human Supervision""?","Recent AI-assistant agents, such as ChatGPT, predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human annotations and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align the output of large language models (LLMs) with human intentions, ensuring they are helpful, ethical, and reliable. However, this dependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant agents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related issues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power of LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our approach encompasses four stages: first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic prompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we use a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles application) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's queries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality self-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable responses for each query directly without the principle set and the demonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the issues of overly-brief or indirect responses. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the LLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary. With fewer than 300 lines of human annotations (including<200 seed prompts, 16 generic principles, and 5 exemplars for in-context learning).

Considering the ongoing shift to achieve efficient use of resources and increased circularity, cooperatives should be better equipped to incorporate circular economy (CE) and eco-innovation (EI) into their strategies (compared to regular enterprises). This paper reviews the scholarly literature focusing on the application of CE and EI within cooperative studies with the aim to understand the relationships between these topics, identify the existing scholarly communities, and to observe salient research themes. This study refined the method of van den Hoven and Rubalcaba (2016) to conduct a two-step bibliographic review of documents: a thematic analysis of citation data from Scopus (including a manual review of 16 papers) was followed by a bibliometric analysis of 101 documents from Web of Science (using R-Studio’s Biblioshiny). Our results identified three intellectual clusters of cooperative studies focusing on the downstream of CE: (1) industrial ecology; (2) recycling; and (3) waste management. Our study also revealed an emerging scholarly field focused on cooperatives and CE, and with little attention to EI. These findings aim at catalyzing the integration of cooperatives more effectively into scholarly discussions, suggesting that environmental sustainability should be recognized as an additional principle of the cooperative identity—providing a wider perspective that enhances interest in the research of these topics and their interconnections."

Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by ~20% absolute on average in task performance.

Not only does the guidance provided by models of human perception and domain knowledge enable better, and more generalizable Machine Listening, in the converse, the lessons learned from these models may be used to verify or improve our models of human perception themselves.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Forest Cover Change Monitoring Using Sub-Pixel Mapping with Edge-Matching Correction""?","Sentinel-2 serves as a crucial data source for monitoring forest cover change. In this study, a sub-pixel mapping of forest cover is performed on Sentinel-2 images, downscaling the spatial resolution of the positioned results to 2.5 m, enabling sub-pixel-level forest cover monitoring. A novel sub-pixel mapping with edge-matching correction is proposed on the basis of the Sentinel-2 images, combining edge-matching technology to extract the forest boundary of Jilin-1 images at sub-meter level as spatial constraint information for sub-pixel mapping. This approach enables accurate mapping of forest cover, surpassing traditional pixel-level monitoring in terms of accuracy and robustness. The corrected mapping method allows more spatial detail to be restored at forest boundaries, monitoring forest changes at a smaller scale, which is highly similar to actual forest boundaries on the surface. The overall accuracy of the modified sub-pixel mapping method reaches 93.15%, an improvement of 1.96% over the conventional Sub-pixel-pixel Spatial Attraction Model (SPSAM).

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Understanding Masked Autoencoders via Hierarchical Latent Variable Models""?","Masked autoencoder (MAE), a simple and effective self-supervised learning framework based on the reconstruction of masked image regions, has recently achieved prominent success in a variety of vision tasks. Despite the emergence of intriguing empirical observations on MAE, a theoretically principled understanding is still lacking. In this work, we formally characterize and justify existing empirical in-sights and provide theoretical guarantees of MAE. We formulate the underlying data-generating process as a hierarchical latent variable model, and show that under reasonable assumptions, MAE provably identifies a set of latent variables in the hierarchical model, explaining why MAE can extract high-level information from pixels. Further, we show how key hyperparameters in MAE (the masking ratio and the patch size) determine which true latent variables to be recovered, therefore influencing the level of semantic information in the representation. Specifically, extremely large or small masking ratios inevitably lead to low-level representations. Our theory offers coherent explanations of existing empirical observations and provides insights for potential empirical improvements and fundamental limitations of the masked-reconstruction paradigm. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical insights."

In the first pass, our architecture predicts ASR transcripts using the ASR subnetwork. This is followed by the LM subnetwork, which makes an initial SLU prediction. Finally, in the third pass, the deliberation subnetwork conditions on representations from the ASR and LM subnetworks to make the final prediction. Our proposed three-pass SLU system shows improved performance over cascaded and E2E SLU models on two benchmark SLU datasets, SLURP and SLUE, especially on acoustically challenging utterances."

Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS) equipped with multispectral cameras can provide information for identifying different vegetation species, including Carpobrotus edulis—one of the most prominent alien species in Portuguese dune ecosystems. This work investigates the use of multispectral UAS for C. edulis identification and biomass estimation. A UAS with a five-band multispectral camera was used to capture images from the sand dunes of the Cávado River spit. Simultaneously, field samples of C. edulis were collected for laboratorial quantification of biomass through Dry Weight (DW). Five supervised classification algorithms were tested to estimate the total area of C. edulis, with the Random Forest algorithm achieving the best results (C. edulis Producer Accuracy (PA) = 0.91, C. edulis User Accuracy (UA) = 0.80, kappa = 0.87, Overall Accuracy (OA) = 0.89). Sixteen vegetation indices (VIs) were assessed to estimate the Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) of C. edulis, using three regression models to correlate the sample areas VI and DW. An exponential regression model of the Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI) presented the best fit for C. edulis DW (R2 = 0.86; p-value < 0.05; normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) = 0.09). This result was later used to estimate the total AGB in the area, which can be used for monitoring and management plans—namely, removal campaigns."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""LoFT: Local Proxy Fine-tuning For Improving Transferability Of Adversarial Attacks Against Large Language Model""?","It has been shown that Large Language Model (LLM) alignments can be circumvented by appending specially crafted attack suffixes with harmful queries to elicit harmful responses. To conduct attacks against private target models whose characterization is unknown, public models can be used as proxies to fashion the attack, with successful attacks being transferred from public proxies to private target models. The success rate of attack depends on how closely the proxy model approximates the private model. We hypothesize that for attacks to be transferrable, it is sufficient if the proxy can approximate the target model in the neighborhood of the harmful query. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \emph{Local Fine-Tuning (LoFT)}, \textit{i.e.}, fine-tuning proxy models on similar queries that lie in the lexico-semantic neighborhood of harmful queries to decrease the divergence between the proxy and target models. First, we demonstrate three approaches to prompt private target models to obtain similar queries given harmful queries. Next, we obtain data for local fine-tuning by eliciting responses from target models for the generated similar queries. Then, we optimize attack suffixes to generate attack prompts and evaluate the impact of our local fine-tuning on the attack's success rate. Experiments show that local fine-tuning of proxy models improves attack transferability and increases attack success rate by $39\%$, $7\%$, and $0.5\%$ (absolute) on target models ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Claude respectively."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""LightSeq: Sequence Level Parallelism for Distributed Training of Long Context Transformers""?","Increasing the context length of large language models (LLMs) unlocks fundamentally new capabilities, but also significantly increases the memory footprints of training. Previous model-parallel systems such as Megatron-LM partition and compute different attention heads in parallel, resulting in large communication volumes, so they cannot scale beyond the number of attention heads, thereby hindering its adoption. In this paper, we introduce a new approach, LightSeq, for long-context LLMs training. LightSeq has many notable advantages. First, LightSeq partitions over the sequence dimension, hence is agnostic to model architectures and readily applicable for models with varying numbers of attention heads, such as Multi-Head, Multi-Query and Grouped-Query attention. Second, LightSeq not only requires up to 4.7x less communication than Megatron-LM on popular LLMs but also overlaps the communication with computation. To further reduce the training time, LightSeq features a novel gradient checkpointing scheme to bypass an forward computation for memory-efficient attention. We evaluate LightSeq on Llama-7B and its variants with sequence lengths from 32K to 512K. Through comprehensive experiments on single and cross-node training, we show that LightSeq achieves up to 1.24-2.01x end-to-end speedup, and a 2-8x longer sequence length on models with fewer heads, compared to Megatron-LM.

Despite these empirical advances, there remain fundamental research questions: how can we quantify the nature of interactions that exist among input features? Subsequently, how can we capture these interactions using suitable data-driven methods? To answer this question, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify the degree of redundancy , uniqueness , and synergy across input features, which we term the PID statistics of a multimodal distribution. Using 2 newly proposed estimators that scale to high-dimensional distributions, we demonstrate their usefulness in quantifying the interactions within multimodal datasets, the nature of interactions captured by multimodal models, and principled approaches for model selection. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets where the PID statistics are known and on large-scale multimodal benchmarks where PID estimation was previously impossible. Finally, to demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach, we present three case studies in pathology, mood prediction, and robotic perception where our framework accurately recommends strong multimodal models for each application."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Identification of Nonlinear Latent Hierarchical Models""?","Identifying latent variables and causal structures from observational data is essential to many real-world applications involving biological data, medical data, and unstructured data such as images and languages. However, this task can be highly challenging, especially when observed variables are generated by causally related latent variables and the relationships are nonlinear. In this work, we investigate the identification problem for nonlinear latent hierarchical causal models in which observed variables are generated by a set of causally related latent variables, and some latent variables may not have observed children. We show that the identifiability of causal structures and latent variables (up to invertible transformations) can be achieved under mild assumptions: on causal structures, we allow for multiple paths between any pair of variables in the graph, which relaxes latent tree assumptions in prior work; on structural functions, we permit general nonlinearity and multi-dimensional continuous variables, alleviating existing work's parametric assumptions. Specifically, we first develop an identification criterion in the form of novel identifiability guarantees for an elementary latent variable model. Leveraging this criterion, we show that both causal structures and latent variables of the hierarchical model can be identified asymptotically by explicitly constructing an estimation procedure. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to establish identifiability guarantees for both causal structures and latent variables in nonlinear latent hierarchical models."

We begin by collecting generation data from a wide range of LLMs, and train neural detectors on data from each generator and test its performance on held-out generators. While none of the detectors can generalize to all generators, we observe a consistent and interesting pattern that the detectors trained on data from a medium-size LLM can zero-shot generalize to the larger version.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Best-Case Retrieval Evaluation: Improving the Sensitivity of Reciprocal Rank with Lexicographic Precision""?","Across a variety of ranking tasks, researchers use reciprocal rank to measure the effectiveness for users interested in exactly one relevant item. Despite its widespread use, evidence suggests that reciprocal rank is brittle when discriminating between systems. This brittleness, in turn, is compounded in modern evaluation settings where current, high-precision systems may be difficult to distinguish. We address the lack of sensitivity of reciprocal rank by introducing and connecting it to the concept of best-case retrieval, an evaluation method focusing on assessing the quality of a ranking for the most satisfied possible user across possible recall requirements. This perspective allows us to generalize reciprocal rank and define a new preference-based evaluation we call lexicographic precision or lexiprecision. By mathematical construction, we ensure that lexiprecision preserves differences detected by reciprocal rank, while empirically improving sensitivity and robustness across a broad set of retrieval and recommendation tasks."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Factorized Contrastive Learning: Going Beyond Multi-view Redundancy""?","In a wide range of multimodal tasks, contrastive learning has become a particularly appealing approach since it can successfully learn representations from abundant unlabeled data with only pairing information (e.g., image-caption or video-audio pairs). Underpinning these approaches is the assumption of multi-view redundancy - that shared information between modalities is necessary and sufficient for downstream tasks. However, in many real-world settings, task-relevant information is also contained in modality-unique regions: information that is only present in one modality but still relevant to the task. How can we learn self-supervised multimodal representations to capture both shared and unique information relevant to downstream tasks? This paper proposes FactorCL, a new multimodal representation learning method to go beyond multi-view redundancy. FactorCL is built from three new contributions: (1) factorizing task-relevant information into shared and unique representations, (2) capturing task-relevant information via maximizing MI lower bounds and removing task-irrelevant information via minimizing MI upper bounds, and (3) multimodal data augmentations to approximate task relevance without labels. On large-scale real-world datasets, FactorCL captures both shared and unique information and achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks"

Recent success of the formulation of the CEF theory on the basis of the point charge model has made it possible to analyze the CEF microscopically. Here, by applying this formulation to the QC Au-SM-Dy (SM=Si, Ge, Al, and Ga) and AC, we theoretically analyze the CEF. In the Dy$^{3+}$ ion with $4f^9$ configuration, the CEF Hamiltonian is diagonalized by the basis set for the total angular momentum $J=15/2$. The ratio of the valences of the screened ligand ions $\alpha=Z_{\rm SM}/Z_{\rm Au}$ plays an important role in characterizing the CEF ground state. For $0\le\alpha<0.30$, the magnetic easy axis for the CEF ground state is shown to be perpendicular to the mirror plane. On the other hand, for $\alpha>0.30$, the magnetic easy axis is shown to be lying in the mirror plane and as $\alpha$ increases, the easy axis rotates to the clockwise direction in the mirror plane at the Dy site and tends to approach the pseudo 5 fold axis. Possible relevance of these results to experiments is discussed."

Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and verified against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed. The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 was reduced by 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q550E. The initial crack angle of 52.5° is the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress intensity factor in the later stage.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""High school students’ data modeling practices and processes: from modeling unstructured data to evaluating automated decisions""?","ABSTRACT It’s critical to foster artificial intelligence (AI) literacy for high school students, the first generation to grow up surrounded by AI, to understand working mechanism of data-driven AI technologies and critically evaluate automated decisions from predictive models. While efforts have been made to engage youth in understanding AI through developing machine learning models, few provided in-depth insights into the nuanced learning processes. In this study, we examined high school students’ data modeling practices and processes. Twenty-eight students developed machine learning models with text data for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. We identified nine data modeling practices that describe students’ processes of model exploration, development, and testing and two themes about evaluating automated decisions from data technologies. The results provide implications for designing accessible data modeling experiences for students to understand data justice as well as the role and responsibility of data modelers in creating AI technologies."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""BUFFET: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Few-shot Cross-lingual Transfer""?","Despite remarkable advancements in few-shot generalization in natural language processing, most models are developed and evaluated primarily in English. To facilitate research on few-shot cross-lingual transfer, we introduce a new benchmark, called BUFFET, which unifies 15 diverse tasks across 54 languages in a sequence-to-sequence format and provides a fixed set of few-shot examples and instructions. BUFFET is designed to establish a rigorous and equitable evaluation framework for few-shot cross-lingual transfer across a broad range of tasks and languages. Using BUFFET, we perform thorough evaluations of state-of-the-art multilingual large language models with different transfer methods, namely in-context learning and fine-tuning. Our findings reveal significant room for improvement in few-shot in-context cross-lingual transfer. In particular, ChatGPT with in-context learning often performs worse than much smaller mT5-base models fine-tuned on English task data and few-shot in-language examples. Our analysis suggests various avenues for future research in few-shot cross-lingual transfer, such as improved pretraining, understanding, and future evaluations."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Multi-Objective Improvement of Android Applications""?","Non-functional properties, such as runtime or memory use, are important to mobile app users and developers, as they affect user experience. Previous work on automated improvement of non-functional properties in mobile apps failed to address the inherent trade-offs between such properties. We propose a practical approach and the first open-source tool, GIDroid (2023), for multi-objective automated improvement of Android apps. In particular, we use Genetic improvement, a search-based technique that navigates the space of software variants to find improved software. We use a simulation-based testing framework to greatly improve the speed of search. GIDroid contains three state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, and two new mutation operators, which cache the results of method calls. Genetic improvement relies on testing to validate patches. Previous work showed that tests in open-source Android applications are scarce. We thus wrote tests for 21 versions of 7 Android apps, creating a new benchmark for performance improvements. We used GIDroid to improve versions of mobile apps where developers had previously found improvements to runtime, memory, and bandwidth use. Our technique automatically re-discovers 64% of existing improvements. We then applied our approach to current versions of software in which there were no known improvements. We were able to improve execution time by up to 35%, and memory use by up to 33% in these apps."

Yet, despite their ever more impressive performance, large-scale neural language models still lack basic theory of mind capabilities out-of-the-box. We posit that simply scaling up models will not imbue them with theory of mind due to the inherently symbolic and implicit nature of the phenomenon, and instead investigate an alternative: can we design a decoding-time algorithm that enhances theory of mind of off-the-shelf neural language models without explicit supervision? We present SymbolicToM, a plug-and-play approach to reason about the belief states of multiple characters in reading comprehension tasks via explicit symbolic representation. More concretely, our approach tracks each entity’s beliefs, their estimation of other entities’ beliefs, and higher-order levels of reasoning, all through graphical representations, allowing for more precise and interpretable reasoning than previous approaches. Empirical results on the well-known ToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019) demonstrate that SymbolicToM dramatically enhances off-the-shelf neural networks’ theory of mind in a zero-shot setting while showing robust out-of-distribution performance compared to supervised baselines. Our work also reveals spurious patterns in existing theory of mind benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of out-of-distribution evaluation and methods that do not overfit a particular dataset."

Currently, there is no universal SE approach that can effectively handle diverse input conditions with a single model. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate this line of research. First, we devise a single SE model that is independent of microphone channels, signal lengths, and sampling frequencies. Second, we design a universal SE benchmark by combining existing public corpora with multiple conditions. Our experiments on a wide range of datasets show that the proposed single model can successfully handle diverse conditions with strong performance."

This paper proposes a method for zero-shot multilingual TTS using text-only data for the target language. The use of text-only data allows the development of TTS systems for low-resource languages for which only textual resources are available, making TTS accessible to thousands of languages. Inspired by the strong cross-lingual transferability of multilingual language models, our framework first performs masked language model pretraining with multilingual text-only data. Then we train this model with a paired data in a supervised manner, while freezing a language-aware embedding layer. This allows inference even for languages not included in the paired data but present in the text-only data. Evaluation results demonstrate highly intelligible zero-shot TTS with a character error rate of less than 12% for an unseen language."

Among the scientific goals of DAMPE are the precise measurements of cosmic-ray electron plus positron spectrum, including the detection of possible indirect dark matter signatures, spectral measurements of primary and secondary cosmic-ray species, and gamma-ray physics. For electrons and gamma rays, it covers an energy range from GeV to about 10 TeV, with an outstanding energy resolution close to 1%. Proton and ion cosmic rays can be measured up to hundreds of TeV in kinetic energy. In this contribution, we first give an overview of the DAMPE mission and its on-orbit operation status. Then, we highlight the key scientific results, including the measurements of the BCNO group, boron-to-carbon ratio, proton plus helium spectrum beyond 100 TeV, gamma-ray physics and more.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""MusicLDM: Enhancing Novelty in Text-to-Music Generation Using Beat-Synchronous Mixup Strategies""?","Diffusion models have shown promising results in cross-modal generation tasks, including text-to-image and text-to-audio generation. However, generating music, as a special type of audio, presents unique challenges due to limited availability of music data and sensitive issues related to copyright and plagiarism. In this paper, to tackle these challenges, we first construct a state-of-the-art text-to-music model, MusicLDM, that adapts Stable Diffusion and AudioLDM architectures to the music domain. We achieve this by retraining the contrastive language-audio pretraining model (CLAP) and the Hifi-GAN vocoder, as components of MusicLDM, on a collection of music data samples. Then, to address the limitations of training data and to avoid plagiarism, we leverage a beat tracking model and propose two different mixup strategies for data augmentation: beat-synchronous audio mixup and beat-synchronous latent mixup, which recombine training audio directly or via a latent embeddings space, respectively. Such mixup strategies encourage the model to interpolate between musical training samples and generate new music within the convex hull of the training data, making the generated music more diverse while still staying faithful to the corresponding style. In addition to popular evaluation metrics, we design several new evaluation metrics based on CLAP score to demonstrate that our proposed MusicLDM and beat-synchronous mixup strategies improve both the quality and novelty of generated music, as well as the correspondence between input text and generated music."

To minimize the public health risk, it is important to monitor antiviral susceptibilities of influenza viruses. Analyses of the antiviral susceptibilities of influenza A and B viruses have been conducted globally; however, those of influenza C and D viruses are limited. Here, we determined the susceptibilities of influenza C viruses representing all six lineages (C/Taylor, C/Yamagata, C/Sao Paulo, C/Aichi, C/Kanagawa, and C/Mississippi) and influenza D viruses representing four lineages (D/OK, D/660, D/Yama2016, and D/Yama2019) to RNA polymerase inhibitors (baloxavir and favipiravir) by using a focus reduction assay. All viruses tested were susceptible to both drugs. We then performed a genetic analysis to check for amino acid substitutions associated with baloxavir and favipiravir resistance and found that none of the viruses tested possessed these substitutions. Use of the focus reduction assay with the genotypic assay has proven valuable for monitoring the antiviral susceptibilities of influenza C and D viruses as well as influenza A and B viruses. Antiviral susceptibility monitoring of all influenza virus types should continue in order to assess the public health risks posed by these viruses."

Reports have indicated that intake of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) benefits the physical health of older individuals requiring nursing care, and athletes, and healthy individuals. But there are few studies investigating the effects of MCTs on subjective health and QOL. The present study sought to evaluate the combined effects of 12-week MCTs supplements and moderate-intensity walking exercise on the subjective health and QOL of middle-aged and older adults aged 60–74 with low BMIs (< 24 kg/m2) and who had no exercise habits. Methods A placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial was conducted. Three MCTs supplement groups with different doses and fatty acid compositions were compared with a control group. The study used the SF-36v2 questionnaire to assess subjective health and health-related QOL (HRQOL). Results The result showed significant improvements in the scores on subscales of the physical QOL, such as Physical functioning and General health, and summary scores on the mental QOL, compared to the control. Conclusion It is estimated that the combination of continuous intake of MCTs and walking exercise may affect HRQOL and improve subjective physical and mental health in sedentary, healthy, middle-aged and older adults.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""LoFT: Local Proxy Fine-tuning For Improving Transferability Of Adversarial Attacks Against Large Language Model""?","It has been shown that Large Language Model (LLM) alignments can be circumvented by appending specially crafted attack suffixes with harmful queries to elicit harmful responses. To conduct attacks against private target models whose characterization is unknown, public models can be used as proxies to fashion the attack, with successful attacks being transferred from public proxies to private target models. The success rate of attack depends on how closely the proxy model approximates the private model. We hypothesize that for attacks to be transferrable, it is sufficient if the proxy can approximate the target model in the neighborhood of the harmful query. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \emph{Local Fine-Tuning (LoFT)}, \textit{i.e.}, fine-tuning proxy models on similar queries that lie in the lexico-semantic neighborhood of harmful queries to decrease the divergence between the proxy and target models. First, we demonstrate three approaches to prompt private target models to obtain similar queries given harmful queries. Next, we obtain data for local fine-tuning by eliciting responses from target models for the generated similar queries. Then, we optimize attack suffixes to generate attack prompts and evaluate the impact of our local fine-tuning on the attack's success rate. Experiments show that local fine-tuning of proxy models improves attack transferability and increases attack success rate by $39\%$, $7\%$, and $0.5\%$ (absolute) on target models ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Claude respectively."

Polyphenols and flavonoids found in Aspalathus linearis—a plant widely consumed as Rooibos tea—are increasingly being investigated for their positive effects on various health issues including inflammation. The aim of our study was to examine the effect of Rooibos extract on obesity and the associated low-grade chronic inflammatory state by testing antioxidant activity, cytokine secretions, macrophage polarization and the differentiation of human adipocytes through the development of adipospheroids. Rooibos extract significantly decreased ROS production and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-2 and IL-17a) in human leukocytes. Additionally, Rooibos extract down-regulated LPS-induced macrophage M1 polarization, shown by a significant decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNFα, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β and CXCL10. In addition, Rooibos inhibited intracellular lipid accumulation and reduced adipogenesis by decreasing the expression of PPARγ, Ap2 and HSL in adipospheroids. A significant decrease in leptin expression was noted and this, more interestingly, was accompanied by a significant increase in adiponectin expression. Using a co-culture system between macrophages and adipocytes, Rooibos extract significantly decreased the expression of all studied pro-inflammatory cytokines and particularly leptin, and increased adiponectin expression. Thus, adding Rooibos tea to the daily diet is likely to prevent the development of obesity associated with chronic low-level inflammation."

This study aimed to develop a radiomics-based model that utilizes preoperative brain MRI for multiclass classification of BCBM subtypes and to investigate whether the model offers better prediction accuracy than the assumption that primary lesions and their BCBMs would be of the same subtype (non-conversion model) in an external validation set. Materials and Methods The training and external validation sets each comprised 51 cases (102 cases total). Four machine learning classifiers combined with three feature selection methods were trained on radiomic features and primary lesion subtypes for prediction of the following four subtypes: 1) hormone receptor (HR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-, 2) HR+/HER2+, 3) HR-/HER2+, and 4) triple-negative. After training, the performance of the radiomics-based model was compared to that of the non-conversion model in an external validation set using accuracy and F1-macro scores. Results The rate of discrepant subtypes between primary lesions and their respective BCBMs were 25.5% (n=13 of 51) in the training set and 23.5% (n=12 of 51) in the external validation set. In the external validation set, the accuracy and F1-macro score of the radiomics-based model were significantly higher than those of the non-conversion model (0.902 vs. 0.765, p=0.004; 0.861 vs. 0.699, p=0.002). Conclusion Our radiomics-based model represents an incremental advance in the classification of BCBM subtypes, thereby facilitating a more appropriate personalized therapy."

In this paper, we propose a method to collect massive-scale and weakly labeled data from the web to benefit the training of VDER models. The collected dataset, named DocumentNet, does not depend on specific document types or entity sets, making it universally applicable to all VDER tasks. The current DocumentNet consists of 30M documents spanning nearly 400 document types organized in a four-level ontology. Experiments on a set of broadly adopted VDER tasks show significant improvements when DocumentNet is incorporated into the pre-training for both classic and few-shot learning settings. With the recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), DocumentNet provides a large data source to extend their multi-modal capabilities for VDER."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Active Retrieval Augmented Generation""?","Despite the remarkable ability of large language models (LMs) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Pre-vaccination CD56 dimCD16 +NK cell abundance and T h1/T h17 ratio predict responsiveness to conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in older adults""?","Older adults are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) infections. There are two available vaccines for pneumococcus: T-cell-independent capsular polysaccharide Pneumovax and T-cell-dependent conjugated Prevnar. However, how older adults respond to these vaccines at the cellular level and whether there are baseline predictors for responsiveness, is not known. To address this, we recruited older adults (60+ yrs), who are vaccinated with Prevnar (n=19) or Pneumovax (n=20). Vaccine responsiveness was quantified using opsonophagocytic assays, which revealed that both vaccines induce strong responses. Interestingly, sex was associated with Prevnar responses, where women mounted stronger responses than men. Pre-vaccination flow cytometry data showed that Th1 cells positively, Th17 cells negatively correlated with Prevnar responses. Furthermore, bulk RNA-seq data from PBMCs showed that baseline expression levels of cytotoxic genes (NCAM1, GNLY, PRF1) are negatively associated with Prevnar responses. scRNA-seq data from top and bottom responders showed that this cytotoxicity signature stems from CD56 dimCD16 +NK cells, where having more of these cells are detrimental to responses. Interestingly, women had significantly higher Th1, lower Th17 and lower CD16+ NK cells compared to men, which explains their stronger Prevnar responses. This is the first study to uncover older adults’ responses to two pneumococcal vaccines; we uncovered an activated immune phenotype of Th and NK cell subsets that impedes responses to Prevnar. Interestingly, this phenotype only affected adjuvanted vaccine responses, providing an opportunity for precision vaccinology for pneumococcus disease.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Computational Language Acquisition with Theory of Mind""?","Unlike current state-of-the-art language models, young children actively acquire language through interactions with their surrounding environment and caretakers. One mechanism that has been argued to be critical to language learning is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack&Woodruff (1978). Drawing inspiration from the modern operationalized versions of ToM implemented in Rabinowitz et al. (2018) and Zhu et al. (2021), we build language-learning agents equipped with ToM, and measure its effects on the learning process. We model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We experiment with varying task difficulty, hypothesizing that models will acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. We find that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in our image referential game setting. We also find some evidence that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation. This suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Contextualized Policy Recovery: Modeling and Interpreting Medical Decisions with Adaptive Imitation Learning""?","Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision policies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits data-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit medical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of decision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors. Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual information. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task learning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear observation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models $\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. CPR is compatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments, and can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or interpretable decision model. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients ($+7.7\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement in predictive performance, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box methods for policy learning, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis of context-specific decision models."

Furthermore, we leverage a hierarchical contrastive loss to pull together article-specific representations of cases at the higher level, leading to distinctive article clusters. The cases in each article cluster are further pulled closer based on their outcome, leading to sub-clusters of cases with similar outcomes.

Granitoids with crystallization ages >3.0 Ga and/or Sm-Nd depleted mantle model ages ≥3.2 Ga define a ~1000 × 100 km belt on the western margin of the Rae craton, Canada, referred to herein as the Perry River terrane (PRT). Zircon U-Pb-Hf-O isotope and whole-rock geochemical data from granitoids show that the PRT is a predominantly juvenile 3.3–3.2 Ga terrane that was partially reworked by more evolved ca. 3.1 Ga magmatism. These findings call for a reassessment of the timing and extent of ancient continental growth on Earth. A global compilation of zircon Hf isotope data from 3.6 to 3.0 Ga igneous rocks reveals clusters of relatively juvenile (initial εHf −2 to +3) rocks at ca. 3.31 and ca. 3.23 Ga, which include samples from the PRT and 13 other terranes worldwide. Other global zircon data sets also document age peaks between 3.3 and 3.2 Ga, and a cluster of broadly chondritic initial εHf values around 3.2 Ga. The 3.3–3.2 Ga period may therefore have been a time of enhanced net continental growth on Earth, and the PRT is one of the largest terranes preserved from that time. Furthermore, zircon Hf isotope data from 3.3–3.1 Ga PRT granitoids and 3.5–3.0 Ga igneous rocks worldwide yield little evidence for parent magmas that interacted with or derived from pre–3.6 Ga continental material. Contrary to some continental-growth models, this latter observation suggests that the volume of continental crust established by 3.6 Ga was relatively small."

However, little is known about the effects of low P availability on P absorption, the photosynthetic electron transport chain, and the antioxidant system in cotton. This study used cotton genotypes (sensitive FJA and DLNTDH and tolerant BX014 and LuYuan343) with contrasting low-P tolerance in a hydroponic experiment under 15 µM, 50 µM, and 500 μM P concentrations. The results showed that low P availability reduced plant development and leaf area, shoot length, and dry weight in FJA and DLNADH, compared to BX014 and LuYuan343. The low P availability decreased the gas-exchange parameters such as the net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance, and increased the intercellular CO2 concentration. Chlorophyll a fluorescence demonstrated that the leaves’ absorption and trapped-energy flux were largely steady. In contrast, considerable gains in absorption and trapped-energy flux per reaction center resulted from decreases in the electron transport per reaction center under low-P conditions. In addition, low P availability reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased the content of malondialdehyde in the cotton genotypes, especially in FJA and DLNTDH. Moreover, low P availability reduced the activity of PEPC and generated a decline in the content of ATP and NADPH. Our research can provide a theoretical physiological basis for the growth and tolerance of cotton under low-P conditions."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA""?","The DialDoc 2023 shared task has expanded the document-grounded dialogue task to encompass multiple languages, despite having limited annotated data. This paper assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained transformer models in a bi-encoder-based dense passage retriever (DPR), concluding that the language-agnostic approach is superior. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of query rewriting techniques using large language models, such as ChatGPT, on multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems. The experiments conducted demonstrate that, for the examples examined, query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries. This failure is due to topic switching in final dialogue turns and irrelevant topics being considered for query rewriting."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Epidemiological Factors Associated with Prescription of Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain in Adults: A Country-Wide, Registry-Based Study in Denmark Spans 2004–2018""?","Purpose Denmark has a high consumption of prescribed opioids, and many citizens with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Therefore, we aimed to characterize and assess epidemiological risk factors associated with long-term non-cancer opioid use among Danish citizens. Patients and Methods We conducted a longitudinal, retrospective, observational, register-based study using nationwide databases containing essential medical, healthcare, and socio-economic information. Statistical analysis, including backward stepwise logistic regression analysis, was used to explain long-term opioid use by individuals filling at least one prescription for an opioid product N02AA01–N02AX06 during 01/01/2004–31/12/2017, follow-up until the end of 2018. Results The analyzed cohort contained N=1,683,713 non-cancer opioid users, of which 979,666 were classified with CNCP diagnosis using ICD-10 codes. Long-term opioid use was predicted by a mean of 1,583.30 and a median of 300 oral morphine equivalent mg (OMEQ) per day during the first year, together with divorced, age group 40–53 years, retirement, receiving social welfare or unemployment ≥6 months. In addition, living in Northern Jutland, co-medications such as beta-blockers, anti-diabetics, anti-rheumatics, and minor surgery ≤90 days before inclusion. Protective variables were an education level of secondary school or higher, children living at home, household income of middle or highest tertile, opioid doses in either the 2nd or 3rd quartile OMEQ, male, the oldest age group, living in the Capital Region or Zealand, co-medication lipid-lowering, one comorbidity, heart failure, surgeries ≤90 days before the index: lips/teeth/jaw/mouth/throat, heart/vessels, elbow/forearm, hip/thigh, knee/lower leg/ankle/foot. Conclusion Long-term opioid users differ epidemiologically from those using opioids for a shorter period. The study findings are essential for future recommendations revision in Denmark and comparable countries."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""The Internal State of an LLM Knows When its Lying""?","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various tasks, one of their most prominent drawbacks is generating inaccurate or false information with a confident tone. In this paper, we provide evidence that the LLM's internal state can be used to reveal the truthfulness of statements. This includes both statements provided to the LLM, and statements that the LLM itself generates. Our approach is to train a classifier that outputs the probability that a statement is truthful, based on the hidden layer activations of the LLM as it reads or generates the statement. Experiments demonstrate that given a set of test sentences, of which half are true and half false, our trained classifier achieves an average of 71\% to 83\% accuracy labeling which sentences are true versus false, depending on the LLM base model. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between our classifier's performance and approaches based on the probability assigned to the sentence by the LLM. We show that while LLM-assigned sentence probability is related to sentence truthfulness, this probability is also dependent on sentence length and the frequencies of words in the sentence, resulting in our trained classifier providing a more reliable approach to detecting truthfulness, highlighting its potential to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated content and its practical applicability in real-world scenarios."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""KALE: Using a K-Sparse Projector for Lexical Expansion""?","Recent research has proposed retrieval approaches based on sparse representations and inverted indexes, with terms produced by neural language models and leveraging the advantages from both neural retrieval and lexical matching. This paper proposes KALE, a new lightweight method of this family that uses a small model with a k-sparse projector to convert dense representations into a sparse set of entries from a latent vocabulary. The KALE vocabulary captures semantic concepts than perform well when used in isolation, and perform better when extending the original lexical vocabulary, this way improving first-stage retrieval accuracy. Experiments with the MSMARCOv1 passage retrieval dataset, the TREC Deep Learning dataset, and BEIR datasets, examined the effectiveness of KALE under varying conditions. Results show that the KALE terms can replace the original lexical vocabulary, with gains in accuracy and efficiency. Combining KALE with the original lexical vocabulary, or with other learned terms, can further improve retrieval accuracy with only a modest increase in computational cost."

This paper describes our examination of research at the intersection of multimodal interaction and affective computing, with the objective of observing trends and identifying understudied areas. We examined over 16,000 papers from selected conferences in multimodal interaction, affective computing, and natural language processing: ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, AAAC International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction, Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. We identified 910 affect-related papers and present our analysis of the role of affective phenomena in these papers. We find that this body of research has primarily focused on enabling machines to recognize or express affect and emotion; there has been limited research on how affect and emotion predictions might, in turn, be used by AI systems to enhance machine understanding of human social behaviors and cognitive states. Based on our analysis, we discuss directions to expand the role of affective phenomena in multimodal interaction research."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""ATLAS: Automatically Detecting Discrepancies Between Privacy Policies and Privacy Labels""?","Privacy policies are long, complex documents that end-users seldom read. Privacy labels aim to ameliorate these issues by providing succinct summaries of salient data practices. In December 2020, Apple began requiring that app developers submit privacy labels describing their apps’ data practices. Yet, research suggests that app developers often struggle to do so. In this paper, we automatically identify possible discrepancies between mobile app privacy policies and their privacy labels. Such discrepancies could be indicators of potential privacy compliance issues. We introduce the Automated Privacy Label Analysis System (ATLAS). ATLAS includes three components: a pipeline to systematically retrieve iOS App Store listings and privacy policies; an ensemble-based classifier capable of predicting privacy labels from the text of privacy policies with 91.3% accuracy using state-of-the-art NLP techniques; and a discrepancy analysis mechanism that enables a large-scale privacy analysis of the iOS App Store. Our system has enabled us to analyze 354,725 iOS apps. We find several interesting trends. For example, only 40.3% of apps in the App Store provide easily accessible privacy policies, and only 29.6% of apps provide both accessible privacy policies and privacy labels. Among apps that provide both, 88.0% have at least one possible discrepancy between the text of their privacy policy and their privacy label, which could be indicative of a potential compliance issue. We find that, on average, apps have 5.32 such potential compliance issues. We hope that ATLAS will help app developers, researchers, regulators, and mobile app stores alike. For example, app developers could use our classifier to check for discrepancies between their privacy policies and privacy labels, and regulators could use our system to help review apps at scale for potential compliance issues."

It results in LLaMA-CoS, a powerful open-source model with advanced tool-planning and tool-calling capabilities. Evaluation on diverse tasks from BIG-bench demonstrates its CoS ability matches that of ChatGPT while its performance surpasses the chain-of-thought approach. Further studies highlight the generalization of LLaMA-CoS to unseen tasks and showcase its capability in using toolkits not explicitly tailored for the target task, affirming its robustness in real-world scenarios.

There has been a growing need for AI moderators to safeguard users as well as protect the mental health of human moderators from traumatic content. While prior works have focused on identifying hateful/offensive language, they are not adequate for meeting the challenges of content moderation since 1) moderation decisions are based on violation of rules, which subsumes detection of offensive speech, and 2) such rules often differ across communities which entails an adaptive solution. We propose to study the challenges of content moderation by introducing a multilingual dataset of 1.8 Million Reddit comments spanning 56 subreddits in English, German, Spanish and French1. We perform extensive experimental analysis to highlight the underlying challenges and suggest related research problems such as cross-lingual transfer, learning under label noise (human biases), transfer of moderation models, and predicting the violated rule.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Mean Platelet Volume in Type 2 Diabetes: Correlation with Poor Glycaemic Control""?","Background: Diabetes is a global pandemic. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is an indicator of increased platelet activity, which is considered to play a role in the development of vascular complications in diabetes. Platelet volume is strongly and independently related with glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Aim: To study the MPV in patients with T2D, and its correlation with HbA1c, duration of T2D, and microvascular complications. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted at the Department of Medicine, Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, India, during a period of 18 months on 300 patients with T2D. Blood glucose, HbA1c, MPV, fundoscopy, and 24-hour urine protein were done. Data were represented as mean+/-standard deviation and statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA). Results: The mean age of patients was 56.64±8.69 years, with 52% of the patients being females. Of these patients, 18.3% had HbA1c between 6.5–8.0%, 51.7% between 8.1–10.0% and the rest above 10.0%. A total of 51% of the patients had diabetes for 6–10 years of duration and 30% for more than 10 years. Patients with higher HbA1c level and prolonged duration of diabetes had higher MPV (p<0.001). Patients with advanced diabetic retinopathy changes and nephropathy also had higher MPV (p<0.05). Conclusion: Measurement of MPV in patients with T2D can be a useful and easily available prognostic marker, and hence assist clinicians to anticipate the occurrence of microvascular complications associated with the disease, especially in resource-poor settings, and reduce the burden of cost for the patient."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""BASS: Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization""?","End-to-end speech summarization has been shown to improve performance over cascade baselines. However, such models are difficult to train on very large inputs (dozens of minutes or hours) owing to compute restrictions and are hence trained with truncated model inputs. Truncation leads to poorer models, and a solution to this problem rests in block-wise modeling, i.e., processing a portion of the input frames at a time. In this paper, we develop a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner. Speech summarization is realized as a streaming process, where hypothesis summaries are updated every block based on new acoustic information. We devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks. Experiments on the How2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed block-wise training method improves by 3 points absolute on ROUGE-L over a truncated input baseline."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Continual Contrastive Spoken Language Understanding""?","Recently, neural networks have shown impressive progress across diverse fields, with speech processing being no exception. However, recent breakthroughs in this area require extensive offline training using large datasets and tremendous computing resources. Unfortunately, these models struggle to retain their previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks continually, and retraining from scratch is almost always impractical. In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning sequence-to-sequence models for spoken language understanding in a class-incremental learning (CIL) setting and we propose COCONUT, a CIL method that relies on the combination of experience replay and contrastive learning. Through a modified version of the standard supervised contrastive loss applied only to the rehearsal samples, COCONUT preserves the learned representations by pulling closer samples from the same class and pushing away the others. Moreover, we leverage a multimodal contrastive loss that helps the model learn more discriminative representations of the new data by aligning audio and text features. We also investigate different contrastive designs to combine the strengths of the contrastive loss with teacher-student architectures used for distillation. Experiments on two established SLU datasets reveal the effectiveness of our proposed approach and significant improvements over the baselines. We also show that COCONUT can be combined with methods that operate on the decoder side of the model, resulting in further metrics improvements."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Gonadotropin Receptor Cross-Talk and Altered Functions in Gonadal and Non-Gonadal Tissues""?","Reproduction depends on the responses of gonadotropins through their specific receptors. The gonadotropin family has three members; Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). These glycoprotein hormones comprise two subunits, an identical α-subunit and a hormone-specific-β subunit. Their cognate receptors (FSHR and LHCGR) are two adrenergic receptor-like family A/rhodopsin-like G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) with structurally distinct ligand binding domains. The hCG binds to LHCGR but has a longer half-life and higher affinity to LHCGR. The expression of FSHR and LHCGR is observed in both gonadal and nongonadal cells. In this review, we will be emphasizing the differential expression of gonadotropin receptors in different cells of the human body, their specific responses through cross-talk, and how a defect in the expression and activity of FSHR and LHCGR may alter the responses of FSH and LH/hCG leading to diseases like PCOS, cancer and metabolic disorders."

We introduce a Wikipedia-derived benchmark, complemented by a rich set of crowd-sourced annotations, that supports $8$ interrelated tasks: (i) extractive summarization; (ii) abstractive summarization; (iii) topic-based summarization; (iv) compressing selected sentences into a one-line summary; (v) surfacing evidence for a summary sentence; (vi) predicting the factual accuracy of a summary sentence; (vii) identifying unsubstantiated spans in a summary sentence; (viii) correcting factual errors in summaries. We compare various methods on this benchmark and discover that on multiple tasks, moderately-sized fine-tuned models consistently outperform much larger few-shot prompted language models. For factuality-related tasks, we also evaluate existing heuristics to create training data and find that training on them results in worse performance than training on $20\times$ less human-labeled data. Our articles draw from $6$ domains, facilitating cross-domain analysis. On some tasks, the amount of training data matters more than the domain where it comes from, while for other tasks training specifically on data from the target domain, even if limited, is more beneficial."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Paaploss: A Phonetic-Aligned Acoustic Parameter Loss for Speech Enhancement""?","Despite rapid advancement in recent years, current speech enhancement models often produce speech that differs in perceptual quality from real clean speech. We propose a learning objective that formalizes differences in perceptual quality, by using domain knowledge of acoustic-phonetics. We identify temporal acoustic parameters – such as spectral tilt, spectral flux, shimmer, etc. – that are non-differentiable, and we develop a neural network estimator that can accurately predict their time-series values across an utterance. We also model phoneme-specific weights for each feature, as the acoustic parameters are known to show different behavior in different phonemes. We can add this criterion as an auxiliary loss to any model that produces speech, to optimize speech outputs to match the values of clean speech in these features. Experimentally we show that it improves speech enhancement workflows in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, as measured by standard evaluation metrics. We also provide an analysis of phoneme-dependent improvement on acoustic parameters, demonstrating the additional interpretability that our method provides. This analysis can suggest which features are currently the bottleneck for improvement."

Results 398 patients were collected, with average weekly expenses for transportation, lodging and food of $17.04, $6.69 and $45.91, respectively. Confirmation was positive between weekly spending and remoteness, likewise it was negative between effective teletherapy and remoteness, both analyses being statistically significant. Conclusion The expense associated with transfer for radiotherapy is high, exceeding the average monthly income of the patient, as a consequence they have a worse therapeutic result, and may cause financial toxicity in cancer patients."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Enhancing the Generalization for Text Classification through Fusion of Backward Features""?","Generalization has always been a keyword in deep learning. Pretrained models and domain adaptation technology have received widespread attention in solving the problem of generalization. They are all focused on finding features in data to improve the generalization ability and to prevent overfitting. Although they have achieved good results in various tasks, those models are unstable when classifying a sentence whose label is positive but still contains negative phrases. In this article, we analyzed the attention heat map of the benchmarks and found that previous models pay more attention to the phrase rather than to the semantic information of the whole sentence. Moreover, we proposed a method to scatter the attention away from opposite sentiment words to avoid a one-sided judgment. We designed a two-stream network and stacked the gradient reversal layer and feature projection layer within the auxiliary network. The gradient reversal layer can reverse the gradient of features in the training stage so that the parameters are optimized following the reversed gradient in the backpropagation stage. We utilized an auxiliary network to extract the backward features and then fed them into the main network to merge them with normal features extracted by the main network. We applied this method to the three baselines of TextCNN, BERT, and RoBERTa using sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection datasets. The results show that our method can improve the sentiment analysis datasets by 0.5% and the sarcasm detection datasets by 2.1%."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Combining non-negative matrix factorization with graph Laplacian regularization for predicting drug-miRNA associations based on multi-source information fusion""?","Increasing evidences suggest that miRNAs play a key role in the occurrence and progression of many complex human diseases. Therefore, targeting dysregulated miRNAs with small molecule drugs in the clinical has become a new treatment. Nevertheless, it is high cost and time-consuming for identifying miRNAs-targeted with drugs by biological experiments. Thus, more reliable computational method for identification associations of drugs with miRNAs urgently need to be developed. In this study, we proposed an efficient method, called GNMFDMA, to predict potential associations of drug with miRNA by combining graph Laplacian regularization with non-negative matrix factorization. We first calculated the overall similarity matrices of drugs and miRNAs according to the collected different biological information. Subsequently, the new drug-miRNA association adjacency matrix was reformulated based on the K nearest neighbor profiles so as to put right the false negative associations. Finally, graph Laplacian regularization collaborative non-negative matrix factorization was used to calculate the association scores of drugs with miRNAs. In the cross validation, GNMFDMA obtains AUC of 0.9193, which outperformed the existing methods. In addition, case studies on three common drugs (i.e., 5-Aza-CdR, 5-FU and Gemcitabine), 30, 31 and 34 of the top-50 associations inferred by GNMFDMA were verified. These results reveal that GNMFDMA is a reliable and efficient computational approach for identifying the potential drug-miRNA associations."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Cuttlefish: Low-Rank Model Training without All the Tuning""?","Recent research has shown that training low-rank neural networks can effectively reduce the total number of trainable parameters without sacrificing predictive accuracy, resulting in end-to-end speedups. However, low-rank model training necessitates adjusting several additional factorization hyperparameters, such as the rank of the factorization at each layer. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing Cuttlefish, an automated low-rank training approach that eliminates the need for tuning factorization hyperparameters. Cuttlefish leverages the observation that after a few epochs of full-rank training, the stable rank (i.e., an approximation of the true rank) of each layer stabilizes at a constant value. Cuttlefish switches from full-rank to low-rank training once the stable ranks of all layers have converged, setting the dimension of each factorization to its corresponding stable rank. Our results show that Cuttlefish generates models up to 5.6 times smaller than full-rank models, and attains up to a 1.2 times faster end-to-end training process while preserving comparable accuracy. Moreover, Cuttlefish outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank model training methods and other prominent baselines.

While malicious bots are becoming more and more sophisticated and personalized, standard bot detection approaches are still agnostic to social environments (henceforth, communities) the bots operate at. In this work, we introduce community-specific bot detection, estimating the percentage of bots given the context of a community. Our method -- BotPercent -- is an amalgamation of Twitter bot detection datasets and feature-, text-, and graph-based models, adjusted to a particular community on Twitter.

We then analyze bot rates in several Twitter groups, including users who engage with partisan news media, political communities in different countries, and more.

However, the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs in AITL and its influence on prognosis. Methods The correlation between CD8+TILs and IC expression in AITL was analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 2), flow cytometry (n = 20), and RNA sequencing (n = 20). Biological changes related to CD8+TILs exhaustion at different cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) levels (mean expression levels of CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1) in AITL were evaluated using RNA sequencing (n = 20) and further validated using the GEO dataset (n = 51). The impact of CD8 protein expression and CTL levels on patient prognosis was analyzed using flow cytometry and RNA sequencing, respectively. Results Our findings demonstrated that the higher the infiltration of CD8+TILs, the higher was the proportion of exhausted CD8+TILs characterized by the overexpression of multiple IC. This was accompanied by extensive exhaustion-related biological changes, which suggested severe exhaustion in CD8+TILs and may be one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with high CD8+TILs and CTL. Conclusion Our study comprehensively reveals the exhaustion status of CD8+TILs and their potential negative impact on AITL prognosis, which facilitates further mechanistic studies and is valuable for guiding immunotherapy strategies."

The API vendors charge their users based on usage, more specifically on the number of ``tokens'' processed or generated by the underlying language models. What constitutes a token, however, is training data and model dependent with a large variance in the number of tokens required to convey the same information in different languages. In this work, we analyze the effect of this non-uniformity on the fairness of an API's pricing policy across languages. We conduct a systematic analysis of the cost and utility of OpenAI's language model API on multilingual benchmarks in 22 typologically diverse languages. We show evidence that speakers of a large number of the supported languages are overcharged while obtaining poorer results. These speakers tend to also come from regions where the APIs are less affordable to begin with. Through these analyses, we aim to increase transparency around language model APIs' pricing policies and encourage the vendors to make them more equitable."

We also train hundreds of diffusion models in various settings to analyze how different modeling and data decisions affect privacy. Overall, our results show that diffusion models are much less private than prior generative models such as GANs, and that mitigating these vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""New Methodology for Intertidal Seaweed Biomass Estimation Using Multispectral Data Obtained with Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles""?","Seaweed assemblages include a variety of structuring species providing habitats, food and shelter for organisms from different trophic levels. Monitoring intertidal seaweed traditionally involves targeting small areas to collect data on species’ biological traits, which is often labour intensive and covers only a small area of the rocky reef under study. Given the various applications for seaweeds and their compounds, there has been an increase in demand for biomass triggered by the development of new markets. Such biomass demand generates new challenges for biomass quantification and the definition of future in-take harvesting commercial quotas by regulating agencies. The use of Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a low-cost yet efficient monitoring solution, combined with new sensors such as multispectral cameras, has been proposed for mapping intertidal reefs and seaweed in particular. In this study, a new methodology was developed and validated to quantify intertidal seaweed biomass based on multispectral UAV imagery, which was made available through an easy-to-use QGIS plugin (named SWUAV_BIO) that automates such biomass estimation. This tool was applied to a case study where the standing stock of Fucus spp. beds located at Viana do Castelo rocky shore (northern Portugal) was assessed using UAV multispectral imagery, providing a reference for future UAV-based ecological studies. Although comparison with the in situ assessments showed that biomass was underestimated by 36%, the SWUAV_BIO plugin is a valuable tool, as it provides an expedited (albeit conservative) seaweed standing stock assessment that can be used to monitor seaweed populations, their changes, and assess the effect of harvesting. These data can be used for an informed and sustainable management of seaweed resources by the competent authorities."

We describe the problem of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in these signals derived from these data sources, where spatial and/or temporal biases are present. We present a method to use a ``guiding'' signal to correct for these biases and produce a more reliable signal that can be used for modeling and forecasting. The method assumes that the heterogeneity can be approximated by a low-rank matrix and that the temporal heterogeneity is smooth over time. We also present a hyperparameter selection algorithm to choose the parameters representing the matrix rank and degree of temporal smoothness of the corrections. In the absence of ground truth, we use maps and plots to argue that this method does indeed reduce heterogeneity. Reducing heterogeneity from auxiliary data sources greatly increases their utility in modeling and forecasting epidemics."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Can Language Models Solve Graph Problems in Natural Language?""?","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for a variety of tasks with implicit graphical structures, such as planning in robotics, multi-hop question answering or knowledge probing, structured commonsense reasoning, and more. While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks with structure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textual descriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces, and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, we propose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark of graph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problems such as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs (GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and find that 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities, 2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on more complex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in the face of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then propose Build-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-based approaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems. Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs on NLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how to solve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with language models remains an open research question.

Our results show that during the decade evaluated, the wind speed and virtual temperature of the upper level atmosphere over the Pearl River Estuary changed very significantly and faster than the changes observed at ground level. During the study period, the linear warming rate of the virtual temperature of the upper level atmosphere reached 0.24°C/a, whereas that on the land surface was 0.17°C/a. The mean decreases in the upper level atmosphere and land surface wind speeds were −0.12 and −0.05 m/s·a, respectively. Additionally, the rate of change in the upper level climate was faster in winter than in summer for both wind speed and virtual temperature. These changes in the climate of the upper level atmosphere over the Pearl River Estuary may be related to the rapid increase in the number of high-rise buildings in the region during that decade, which generally negatively affected the atmospheric environment."

The purpose of this study was to associate in a single compound metal-based drugs and photosensitizers to combine chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. Two arene–ruthenium tetrapyridylporphyrin compounds (2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru) have been synthesized and evaluated on two colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116 and HT-29).

The results showed that the two arene–ruthenium photosensitizer-containing complexes have a strong phototoxic effect after photoactivation. The 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru complex induced outstanding cytotoxicity when compared to the Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru analogue.

In this paper, we propose an input feature modification and a training objective modification based on two assumptions. First, harmonics in the spectrograms of audio data decay rapidly along the frequency axis. To enhance the model's sensitivity on the trailing harmonics, we modify the Combined Frequency and Periodicity (CFP) representation using discrete z-transform. Second, the vocal and non-vocal segments with extremely short duration are uncommon. To ensure a more stable melody contour, we design a differentiable loss function that prevents the model from predicting such segments. We apply these modifications to several models, including MSNet, FTANet, and a newly introduced model, PianoNet, modified from a piano transcription network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modifications are empirically effective for singing melody extraction."

Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world’s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language’s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT’s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages."

However, given the enormous range of factors that can possibly influence voice, more informed methods for selecting those that may be potentially deducible from voice are needed. To this end, this paper proposes a simple path-finding algorithm that attempts to find links between vocal characteristics and perturbing factors using cytogenetic and genomic data. The links represent reasonable selection criteria for use by computational by profiling technologies only, and are not intended to establish any unknown biological facts. The proposed algorithm is validated using a simple example from medical literature—that of the clinically observed effects of specific chromosomal microdeletion syndromes on the vocal characteristics of affected people. In this example, the algorithm attempts to link the genes involved in these syndromes to a single example gene (FOXP2) that is known to play a broad role in voice production. We show that in cases where strong links are exposed, vocal characteristics of the patients are indeed reported to be correspondingly affected. Validation experiments and subsequent analyses confirm that the methodology could be potentially useful in predicting the existence of vocal signatures in naïve cases where their existence has not been otherwise observed."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Chinese EFL learners different from English natives in cataphora resolution: Evidence from eye-tracking studies""?","Previous studies on English natives have shown that encountering an English cataphoric pronoun triggers an active search for its antecedent and this searching process is modulated by syntactic constraints. It remains unknown whether the conclusion is universal to EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners, particularly those with distinct L1 like Chinese in linguistic typology. Therefore, this study used two eye-tracking experiments to investigate how Chinese EFL learners resolve English cataphora. The experiments adopted the gender-mismatch paradigm. Experiment 1 investigated whether Chinese EFL learners with different proficiency would adopt the similar processing pattern to English natives and found that gender congruency elicited longer reading times than gender incongruency between the first potential antecedent and the cataphoric pronoun, the effect early observed in high-proficiency relative to low-proficiency learners. Experiment 2 explored whether the cataphora resolution process was modulated by Binding Principle B and revealed that longer first fixation durations and first pass reading times were observed in gender-mismatch than in gender-match conditions no matter the antecedents are binding-accessible or not while longer regression path durations occurred in gender-mismatch than in gender-match conditions only as the antecedents are binding-accessible. Taken together, these results indicate that Chinese EFL learners also adopt an active search mechanism to resolve cataphoric pronouns, yet along a processing path distinct from English natives’. Specifically, Chinese EFL learners predictively link a cataphoric pronoun to the first potential antecedent in the sentence but only a gender-matching antecedent can prompt them to engage in deep processing of the antecedent. Moreover, the processing time varies with the learners’ English proficiency. Furthermore, unlike native English speakers’ early application of syntactic constraints in their cataphora resolution, Chinese EFL learners try to establish co-reference relations between cataphoric pronouns and antecedents regardless of following or flouting Binding Principle B in early processing stages whereas they exclusively link the cataphoric pronouns to the binding-accessible antecedents in late processing stages. This study adds evidence to the Shallow Structure Hypothesis whereby L2 learners resort to lexical prior to syntactic cues to process sentences in general, which is just opposite to the fashion adopted by the natives."

In this study, Himawari-8 data of forest fire smoke in Xichang and Linzhi were selected. An improved sub-pixel mapping method based on random forest results was proposed to realize the identification and sub-pixel positioning of smoke. More spatial details of forest fire smoke were restored in the final results. The continuous monitoring of smoke indicated the dynamic changes therein. The accuracy evaluation of smoke detection was realized using a confusion matrix. Based on the improved sub-pixel mapping method, the overall accuracies were 87.95% and 86.32%. Compared with the raw images, the smoke contours of the improved sub-pixel mapping results were clearer and smoother. The improved sub-pixel mapping method outperforms traditional classification methods in locating smoke range. Moreover, it especially made a breakthrough in the limitations of the pixel scale and in realizing sub-pixel positioning. Compared with the results of the classic PSA method, there were fewer “spots” and “holes” after correction. The final results of this study show higher accuracies of smoke discrimination, with it becoming the basis for another method of forest fire monitoring."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Membership Inference Attacks against Language Models via Neighbourhood Comparison""?","Membership Inference attacks (MIAs) aim to predict whether a data sample was present in the training data of a machine learning model or not, and are widely used for assessing the privacy risks of language models. Most existing attacks rely on the observation that models tend to assign higher probabilities to their training samples than non-training points. However, simple thresholding of the model score in isolation tends to lead to high false-positive rates as it does not account for the intrinsic complexity of a sample. Recent work has demonstrated that reference-based attacks which compare model scores to those obtained from a reference model trained on similar data can substantially improve the performance of MIAs. However, in order to train reference models, attacks of this kind make the strong and arguably unrealistic assumption that an adversary has access to samples closely resembling the original training data. Therefore, we investigate their performance in more realistic scenarios and find that they are highly fragile in relation to the data distribution used to train reference models. To investigate whether this fragility provides a layer of safety, we propose and evaluate neighbourhood attacks, which compare model scores for a given sample to scores of synthetically generated neighbour texts and therefore eliminate the need for access to the training data distribution. We show that, in addition to being competitive with reference-based attacks that have perfect knowledge about the training data distribution, our attack clearly outperforms existing reference-free attacks as well as reference-based attacks with imperfect knowledge, which demonstrates the need for a reevaluation of the threat model of adversarial attacks."

To mitigate this issue, we present context-aware decoding (CAD), which follows a contrastive output distribution that amplifies the difference between the output probabilities when a model is used with and without context. Our experiments show that CAD, without additional training, significantly improves the faithfulness of different LM families, including OPT, GPT, LLaMA and FLAN-T5 for summarization tasks (e.g., 14.3% gain for LLaMA in factuality metrics). Furthermore, CAD is particularly effective in overriding a model's prior knowledge when it contradicts the provided context, leading to substantial improvements in tasks where resolving the knowledge conflict is essential."

In this work, we seek to investigate whether using this ontological information will improve learning from weakly labeled data, which are easier to collect since it requires only the presence or absence of an event to be known. We use the AudioSet ontology and dataset, which contains audio clips weakly labeled with the ontology concepts and the ontology providing the ""Is A"" relations between the concepts. We first re-implemented the model proposed by [1] with modifications to fit the multi-label scenario and then expand on that idea by using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to model the ontology information to learn the concepts. We find that the baseline Twin Neural Network (TNN) does not perform better by incorporating ontology information in the weak and multi-label scenario, but that the GCN does capture the ontology knowledge better for weak, multi-labeled data. We also investigate how different modules can tolerate noises introduced from weak labels and better incorporate ontology information. Our best TNN-GCN model achieves mAP=0.45 and AUC=0.87 for lower-level concepts and mAP=0.72 and AUC=0.86 for higher-level concepts, which is an improvement over the baseline TNN but about the same as our models that do not use ontology information."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Assessing and comparing alternative certification programs: The teacher-classroom-community model""?","Alternative certification programs (ACPs) differ from traditional teacher certification programs in their target populations, duration, tools they employ, their pedagogy, and subject matter curricula. Given the acute shortage of excellent teachers, especially in STEM, significant efforts and resources are invested in ACPs so they prepare highly qualified teachers. Yet, novice teachers face difficulties during their initial integration into the school system. To better understand the state of affairs, we investigated and compared the integration into the school system of graduates of five major Israeli ACPs that are tailored for diverse student-teacher target audiences. The study goals were to (1) investigate and compare the integration of graduates of the five ACPs into the teaching profession with respect to five teacher-related aspects: (a) self-efficacy, (b) commitment to the teaching profession, (c) challenges encountered, (d) leadership roles, and (e) teamwork; (2) identify ACP characteristics that support the graduates’ integration into the teaching profession. The teacher-classroom-community model we propose, holistically connects three aspects: affective – the teacher, the teaching profession – the classroom, and peer interaction and leadership – the school community. The model provides a common language for comparing how the different ACPs prepared their graduates toward the teaching profession. The model is instrumental for identifying ACP characteristics that support graduates’ integration into teaching and facilitating ACP evaluation by connecting several aspects of teachers’ professional lives. The study employed a mixed-methodology in which 506 graduates responded to a closed- and open-ended questionnaire and 71 interviews were conducted with graduates (novice teachers), ACP directors, school principals and mentor teachers. The findings depict a complex picture that reflects the different ACPs’ characteristics targeted at diverse audiences. For example, graduates of STEM-oriented programs perceive the different kinds of knowledge, including content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge, as most important to their roles in schools. They undertake fewer roles, and the ones they do assume are discipline-related. Graduates of the more social-leadership-oriented programs identify developing leadership skills as most beneficial and they undertake more leadership-related roles. The research highlights key aspects that teacher education leaders should consider and use for self-evaluation of their ACPs. The strength of this study stems from proposing and applying the teacher-classroom-community model for evaluating teacher certification programs in several contexts and for diverse groups along with their integration into schools."

In this article, we present the near-full-length AIRR-seq (FLAIRR-seq) method that uses targeted amplification by 5' RACE, combined with single-molecule, real-time sequencing to generate highly accurate (99.99%) human Ab H chain transcripts. FLAIRR-seq was benchmarked by comparing H chain V (IGHV), D (IGHD), and J (IGHJ) gene usage, complementarity-determining region 3 length, and somatic hypermutation to matched datasets generated with standard 5' RACE AIRR-seq using short-read sequencing and full-length isoform sequencing. Together, these data demonstrate robust FLAIRR-seq performance using RNA samples derived from PBMCs, purified B cells, and whole blood, which recapitulated results generated by commonly used methods, while additionally resolving H chain gene features not documented in IMGT at the time of submission. FLAIRR-seq data provide, for the first time, to our knowledge, simultaneous single-molecule characterization of IGHV, IGHD, IGHJ, and IGHC region genes and alleles, allele-resolved subisotype definition, and high-resolution identification of class switch recombination within a clonal lineage. In conjunction with genomic sequencing and genotyping of IGHC genes, FLAIRR-seq of the IgM and IgG repertoires from 10 individuals resulted in the identification of 32 unique IGHC alleles, 28 (87%) of which were previously uncharacterized.

It represents knowledge in the form of nodes and links in a network structure, and it can perform basic inference about the relationships between different elements efficiently. On its own, Scone acts as a sort of""smart memory""that can interface with other software systems. One area of improvement for Scone is how useful it can be in supplying knowledge to an intelligent agent that can use the knowledge to perform actions and update the knowledge base with its observations. We augment the Scone system with a production rule engine that automatically performs simple inference based on existing and newly-added structures in Scone's knowledge base, potentially improving the capabilities of any planning systems built on top of Scone. Production rule systems consist of""if-then""production rules that try to match their predicates to existing knowledge and fire their actions when their predicates are satisfied. We propose two kinds of production rules, if-added and if-needed rules, that differ in how they are checked and fired to cover multiple use cases. We then implement methods to efficiently check and fire these rules in a large knowledge base. The new rule engine is not meant to be a complex stand-alone planner, so we discuss how it fits into the context of Scone and future work on planning systems."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""A Pretrainer's Guide to Training Data: Measuring the Effects of Data Age, Domain Coverage, Quality, & Toxicity""?","Pretraining is the preliminary and fundamental step in developing capable language models (LM). Despite this, pretraining data design is critically under-documented and often guided by empirically unsupported intuitions. To address this, we pretrain 28 1.5B parameter decoder-only models, training on data curated (1) at different times, (2) with varying toxicity and quality filters, and (3) with different domain compositions. First, we quantify the effect of pretraining data age. A temporal shift between evaluation data and pretraining data leads to performance degradation, which is not overcome by finetuning. Second, we explore the effect of quality and toxicity filters, showing a trade-off between performance on standard benchmarks and risk of toxic generations. Our findings indicate there does not exist a one-size-fits-all solution to filtering training data. We also find that the effects of different types of filtering are not predictable from text domain characteristics. Lastly, we empirically validate that the inclusion of heterogeneous data sources, like books and web, is broadly beneficial and warrants greater prioritization. These findings constitute the largest set of experiments to validate, quantify, and expose many undocumented intuitions about text pretraining, which we hope will help support more informed data-centric decisions in LM development."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Energy-dependent polarization of Gamma-Ray Bursts' prompt emission with the POLAR and POLAR-2 instruments""?","Gamma-Ray Bursts are among the most powerful events in the Universe. Despite half a century of observations of these transient sources, many open questions remain about their nature. Polarization measurements of the GRB prompt emission have long been theorized to be able to answer most of these questions. With the aim of characterizing the polarization of these prompt emissions, a compact Compton polarimeter, called POLAR, has been launched to space in September 2016. Time integrated polarization analysis of the POLAR GRB catalog have shown that the prompt emission is lowly polarized or fully unpolarized. However, time resolved analysis depicted strong hints of an evolving polarization angle within single pulses, washing out the polarization degree in time integrated analyses. Here we will for the first time present energy resolved polarization measurements with the POLAR data. The novel analysis, performed on several GRBs, will provide new insights and alter our understanding of GRB polarization. The analysis was performed using the 3ML framework to fit polarization parameters versus energy in parallel to the spectral parameters. Although limited by statistics, the results could provide a very relevant input to disentangle between existing theoretical models. In order to gather more statistics per GRB and perform joint time and energy resolved analysis, a successor instrument, called POLAR-2, is under development with a launch window early 2025 to the CSS. After presenting the first energy resolved polarization results of the POLAR mission, we will present the prospects for such measurements with the upcoming POLAR-2 mission."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Magnetism and topological property in icosahedral quasicrystal""?","Quasicrystal (QC) has no periodicity but has a unique rotational symmetry forbidden in periodic crystals. Lack of microscopic theory of the crystalline electric field (CEF) in the QC and approximant crystal (AC) has prevented us from understanding the electric property, especially the magnetism. By developing the general formulation of the CEF in the rare-earth based QC and AC, we have analyzed the CEF in the QC Au-SM-Tb and AC (SM=Si, Ge, and Ga). The magnetic anisotropy arising from the CEF plays an important role in realizing unique magnetic states on the icosahedron (IC). By constructing the minimal model with the magnetic anisotropy, we have analyzed the ground-state properties of the IC, 1/1 AC, and QC. The hedgehog state is characterized by the topological charge of one and the whirling-moment state is characterized by the topological charge of three. The uniform arrangement of the ferrimagnetic state is stabilized in the QC with the ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, which is a candidate for the magnetic structure recently observed FM long-range order in the QC Au-Ga-Tb. The uniform arrangement of the hedgehog state is stabilized in the QC with the antiferromagnetic interaction, which suggests the possibility of the topological magnetic long-range order."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Latent Landmark Graphs""?","Goal-Conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) is a promising paradigm to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning. It decomposes the source task into sub goal conditional subtasks and conducts exploration and exploitation in the subgoal space. The effectiveness of GCHRL heavily relies on sub goal representation functions and sub goal selection strategy. However, existing works often overlook the temporal coherence in GCHRL when learning latent sub goal representations and lack an efficient sub goal selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation. This paper proposes HIerarchical reinforcement learning via dynamically building Latent Landmark graphs (HILL) to overcome these limitations. HILL learns latent subgoal representations that satisfy temporal coherence using a contrastive representation learning objective. Based on these representations, HILL dynamically builds latent landmark graphs and employs a novelty measure on nodes and a utility measure on edges. Finally, HILL develops a subgoal selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation by jointly considering both measures. Experimental results demonstrate that HILL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on continuous control tasks with sparse rewards in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/papercode2022/HILL."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Analysis of Individual Cosmic-Ray Proton and Helium Fluxes towards PeV Energies with DAMPE""?","The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a satellite-borne experiment, in operation since 2015, aimed at studying cosmic rays and high-energy gamma rays. Proton and helium are the first-and second-most abundant components in cosmic rays. Given their smaller interaction cross sections with the interstellar medium, compared to heavier nuclei, they can travel larger distances, thereby becoming important probes to cosmic-ray sources as well as acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Recently, in the DAMPE collaboration, machine learning (ML) techniques were developed and deployed to improve particle tracking and identification and correct for the calorimeter readout saturation at high energies. This work presents a direct measurement of the energy spectra of cosmic-ray protons and helium nuclei, using 84 and 81 months of data, respectively, recorded by DAMPE. Application of the above-mentioned ML techniques helps in extending the spectra to higher kinetic energies than those previously reported by DAMPE"

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""AdapITN: A Fast, Reliable, and Dynamic Adaptive Inverse Text Normalization""?","Inverse text normalization (ITN) is the task that transforms text in spoken-form into written-form. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) produces text in spoken-form, human and natural language understanding systems prefer to consume text in written-form. ITN generally deals with semiotic phrases (e.g., numbers, date, time). However, lack of studies to deal with phonetization phrases, which is ASR’s output when it handles unseen data (e.g., foreign-named entities, domain names), although these exist in the same form in the spoken-form text. The reason is that phonetization phrases are infinite patterns and language-dependent. In this study, we introduce a novel end2end model that can handle both semiotic phrases (SEP) and phonetization phrases (PHP), named AdapITN. We call it ""Adap"" because it allows for handling unseen PHP. The model performs only when necessary by providing a mechanism to narrow normalized regions and external query knowledge, reducing the runtime significantly."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Research on Comprehensive Performance Optimization Method of Explosives and Propellants Oriented to the Whole Process""?","Explosives and propellants are common basic energy for weapons and equipment to achieve delivery, damage, and control, and are an important manifestation of national defense power. However, due to the wide variety of products and complex performance, the traditional serial design optimization mode can no longer meet the requirements of product diversification and rapid development. In this paper, the design process of explosives is deeply studied, and a method for optimizing the comprehensive performance of explosives and propellants oriented to the whole process is proposed. The method uses a comprehensive performance optimization engine to numerically model different design links in a unified parameter space, connects different links horizontally, and adopts a multi-objective optimization algorithm to comprehensively consider the optimization objectives of different links, realizing the automatic execution of the optimization process according to the design process. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, this paper optimizes the formula of explosives and propellants based on two different types of explosives, gun propellant and rocket propellant. Experimental results show that this method improves the design efficiency and improves product quality under the premise of ensuring safety and manufacturability."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Value Kaleidoscope: Engaging AI with Pluralistic Human Values, Rights, and Duties""?","Human values are crucial to human decision-making. Value pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a friend to protect their feelings, how does one balance honesty with friendship?). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to averages by default, washing out these potentially irreducible value conflicts. To improve AI systems to better reflect value pluralism, the first-order challenge is to explore the extent to which AI systems can model pluralistic human values, rights, and duties as well as their interaction. We introduce ValuePrism, a large-scale dataset of 218k values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written situations. ValuePrism's contextualized values are generated by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91% of the time. We conduct a large-scale study with annotators across diverse social and demographic backgrounds to try to understand whose values are represented. With ValuePrism, we build Kaleido, an open, light-weight, and structured language-based multi-task model that generates, explains, and assesses the relevance and valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human values, rights, and duties within a specific context. Humans prefer the sets of values output by our system over the teacher GPT-4, finding them more accurate and with broader coverage. In addition, we demonstrate that Kaleido can help explain variability in human decision-making by outputting contrasting values. Finally, we show that Kaleido's representations transfer to other philosophical frameworks and datasets, confirming the benefit of an explicit, modular, and interpretable approach to value pluralism. We hope that our work will serve as a step to making more explicit the implicit values behind human decision-making and to steering AI systems to make decisions that are more in accordance with them."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Active Retrieval Augmented Generation""?","Despite the remarkable ability of large language models (LMs) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Expression of ALCAM in Clinical Colon Cancer and Relationship With Patients’ Treatment Responses""?","Background/Aim: Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) plays an important role in cancer via its homotypical and heterotypical interactions with ALCAM or other proteins and can also mediate cell-cell interactions. The present study investigated the expression of ALCAM in relation to epithelial–to–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and its downstream signal proteins including Ezrin-Moesin-Radixin (ERM), in clinical colon cancer and in the progression of the disease. Materials and Methods: Expression of ALCAM was determined in a clinical colon cancer cohort and assessed against the clinical pathological factors and outcome, together with the expression patterns of the ERM family and EMT markers. ALCAM protein was detected using immunohistochemistry. Cell line models, with ALCAM knock-down and over-expression, were established and used to test cells’ responses to drugs. Results: Tumours from patients who had distant metastasis and died of colon cancer had low levels of ALCAM. Dukes B and C tumours also had lower ALCAM expression than Dukes A tumours. Patients with high levels of ALCAM had a significantly longer overall and disease-free survival than those with lower ALCAM levels (p=0.040 and p=0.044). ALCAM is not only significantly correlated with SNAI1 and TWIST, also positively correlated with SNAI2. ALCAM enhanced the adhesiveness of colorectal cancer, an effect inhibited by both sALCAM and SRC inhibitors. Finally, high ALCAM expression rendered cells resistant, especially to 5-fluorouracil. Conclusion: Reduced expression of ALCAM in colon cancer is an indicator of disease progression and a poor prognostic indicator for patient’s survival.

Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these different approaches in realistic scenarios. However, currently only specific aspects of the systems are evaluated and often it is not possible to compare different approaches. In this work, we propose the first framework to perform and evaluate the various aspects of low-latency speech translation under realistic conditions. The evaluation is carried out in an end-to-end fashion. This includes the segmentation of the audio as well as the run-time of the different components. Secondly, we compare different approaches to low-latency speech translation using this framework. We evaluate models with the option to revise the output as well as methods with fixed output. Furthermore, we directly compare state-of-the-art cascaded as well as end-to-end systems. Finally, the framework allows to automatically evaluate the translation quality as well as latency and also provides a web interface to show the low-latency model outputs to the user."

Based on their commonalities, we train an unsupervised dense retriever, Anchor-DR, with a contrastive learning task that matches the anchor text and the linked document. To filter out uninformative anchors (such as ""homepage"" or other functional anchors), we present a novel filtering technique to only select anchors that contain similar types of information as search queries. Experiments show that Anchor-DR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unsupervised dense retrieval by a large margin (e.g., by 5.3% NDCG@10 on MSMARCO). The gain of our method is especially significant for search and question answering tasks.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Augmentation-Adapted Retriever Improves Generalization of Language Models as Generic Plug-In""?","Retrieval augmentation can aid language models (LMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks by supplying them with external information. Prior works on retrieval augmentation usually jointly fine-tune the retriever and the LM, making them closely coupled. In this paper, we explore the scheme of generic retrieval plug-in: the retriever is to assist target LMs that may not be known beforehand or are unable to be fine-tuned together. To retrieve useful documents for unseen target LMs, we propose augmentation-adapted retriever (AAR), which learns LM’s preferences obtained from a known source LM. Experiments on the MMLU and PopQA datasets demonstrate that our AAR trained with a small source LM is able to significantly improve the zero-shot generalization of larger target LMs ranging from 250M Flan-T5 to 175B InstructGPT. Further analysis indicates that the preferences of different LMs overlap, enabling AAR trained with a single source LM to serve as a generic plug-in for various target LMs. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/OpenMatch/Augmentation-Adapted-Retriever."

However, they often suffer from slow inference. This is primarily attributed to the incremental calculation of the decoder. This work proposes a partially AR framework, which employs segment-level vectorized beam search for improving the inference speed of an ASR model based on the hybrid connectionist temporal classification (CTC) attention-based architecture. It first generates an initial hypothesis using greedy CTC decoding, identifying low-confidence tokens based on their output probabilities. We then utilize the decoder to perform segment-level vectorized beam search on these tokens, re-predicting in parallel with minimal decoder calculations. Experimental results show that our method is 12 to 13 times faster in inference on the LibriSpeech corpus over AR decoding whilst preserving high accuracy."

In absence of training data from the target domain, we use a retrieval-based approach (kNN-MT) for effective adaptation (+0.8 BLEU for speech translation). We also use adapters to easily integrate incremental training data from data augmentation, and show that it matches the performance of re-training. We observe that cascaded systems are more easily adaptable towards specific target domains, due to their separate modules.

To overcome the scarce amount of supervised data, we design a random data synthesis procedure that aims to simulate bends, fractures, and inking variations induced by the early printing process. Our method successfully improves downstream damaged type-imprint matching among printed works from this period, as validated by in-domain human experts.

In this paper, we present a human-centric evaluation of OCR systems, focusing on the Kwak'wala language as a case study. With a user study, we show that utilizing OCR reduces the time spent in the manual transcription of culturally valuable documents -- a task that is often undertaken by endangered language community members and researchers -- by over 50%.

We propose an objective for perceptual quality based on temporal acoustic parameters. These are fundamental speech features that play an essential role in various applications, including speaker recognition and paralinguistic analysis. We provide a differentiable estimator for four categories of low-level acoustic descriptors involving: frequency-related parameters, energy or amplitude-related parameters, spectral balance parameters, and temporal features. Un-like prior work that looks at aggregated acoustic parameters or a few categories of acoustic parameters, our temporal acoustic parameter (TAP) loss enables auxiliary optimization and improvement of many fine-grained speech characteristics in enhancement workflows. We show that adding TAPLoss as an auxiliary objective in speech enhancement produces speech with improved perceptual quality and intelligibility. We use data from the Deep Noise Suppression 2020 Challenge to demonstrate that both time-domain models and time-frequency domain models can benefit from our method."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""FedNAR: Federated Optimization with Normalized Annealing Regularization""?","Weight decay is a standard technique to improve generalization performance in modern deep neural network optimization, and is also widely adopted in federated learning (FL) to prevent overfitting in local clients. In this paper, we first explore the choices of weight decay and identify that weight decay value appreciably influences the convergence of existing FL algorithms. While preventing overfitting is crucial, weight decay can introduce a different optimization goal towards the global objective, which is further amplified in FL due to multiple local updates and heterogeneous data distribution. To address this challenge, we develop {\it Federated optimization with Normalized Annealing Regularization} (FedNAR), a simple yet effective and versatile algorithmic plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into any existing FL algorithms. Essentially, we regulate the magnitude of each update by performing co-clipping of the gradient and weight decay. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of FedNAR's convergence rate and conduct extensive experiments on both vision and language datasets with different backbone federated optimization algorithms. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate that incorporating FedNAR into existing FL algorithms leads to accelerated convergence and heightened model accuracy. Moreover, FedNAR exhibits resilience in the face of various hyperparameter configurations. Specifically, FedNAR has the ability to self-adjust the weight decay when the initial specification is not optimal, while the accuracy of traditional FL algorithms would markedly decline.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""DPHuBERT: Joint Distillation and Pruning of Self-Supervised Speech Models""?","Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved notable success in many speech processing tasks, but the large model size and heavy computational cost hinder the deployment. Knowledge distillation trains a small student model to mimic the behavior of a large teacher model. However, the student architecture usually needs to be manually designed and will remain fixed during training, which requires prior knowledge and can lead to suboptimal performance. Inspired by recent success of task-specific structured pruning, we propose DPHuBERT, a novel task-agnostic compression method for speech SSL based on joint distillation and pruning. Experiments on SUPERB show that DPHuBERT outperforms pure distillation methods in almost all tasks. Moreover, DPHuBERT requires little training time and performs well with limited training data, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications. Our method can also be applied to various speech SSL models. Our code and models will be publicly available."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Enhancing Speech-To-Speech Translation with Multiple TTS Targets""?","It has been known that direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models usually suffer from the data scarcity issue because of the limited existing parallel materials for both source and target speech. Therefore to train a direct S2ST system, previous works usually utilize text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate samples in the target language by augmenting the data from speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, there is a limited investigation into how the synthesized target speech would affect the S2ST models. In this work, we analyze the effect of changing synthesized target speech for direct S2ST models. We find that simply combining the target speech from different TTS systems can potentially improve the S2ST performances. Following that, we also propose a multi-task framework that jointly optimizes the S2ST system with multiple targets from different TTS systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves consistent improvements (2.8 BLEU) over the baselines on the Fisher Spanish-English dataset."

Thirty human enamel specimens were prepared and randomized to receive three dental erosion-abrasion (EA) protocols: severe (s-EA, lemon juice/pH:2.5/4.25%w/v citric acid), moderate (m-EA, grapefruit juice/pH:3.5/1.03%w/v citric acid) and no-EA (water, control). EA challenge was performed by exposing the specimens to acidic solutions 4x/day and to brushing 2x/day with 1:3 fluoridated toothpaste slurry, for 14 days. Enamel thickness measurements were obtained using CP-OCT at baseline (D0), 7 (D7) and 14 days (D14) and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) at D14. Enamel surface loss was measured with both CP-OCT and optical profilometry at D0, D7 and D14. Data was analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and Pearson's correlation (r) (α = 0.05). CP-OCT enamel thickness decreased over time in the s-EA group (D0 >D7 > D14, p < 0.001) and m-EA group (D0 > D14, p = 0.019) but did not change in the no-EA group (p = 0.30). Overall, CP-OCT and micro-CT results at D14 correlated moderately (r = 0.73). CP-OCT surface loss was highest for s-EA (p <0.001) but did not differ between moderate and no-EA (p = 0.25). Enamel surface loss with profilometry increased with severity (no-EA>m-EA>s-EA, p < 0.001). D14 surface loss was higher than D7 for both methods except for the no-EA group with profilometry. CP-OCT and profilometry had moderate overall correlation (r = 0.70). Our results revealed that the currently proposed in vitro dental erosion-abrasion model is valid and could simulate lesions of different severities over time. CP-OCT was a suitable method for monitoring the EA lesions."

Following last year’s success, we also included a challenge set subtask, where participants had to create contrastive test suites for evaluating metrics’ ability to capture and penalise specific types of translation errors. Furthermore, we improved our meta-evaluation procedure by considering fewer tasks and calculating a global score by weighted averaging across the various tasks. We present an extensive analysis on how well metrics perform on three language pairs: Chinese-English, Hebrew-English on the sentence-level and English-German on the paragraph-level. The results strongly confirm the results reported last year, that neural-based metrics are significantly better than non-neural metrics in their levels of correlation with human judgments. Further, we investigate the impact of bad reference translations on the correlations of metrics with human judgment. We present a novel approach for generating synthetic reference translations based on the collection of MT system outputs and their corresponding MQM ratings, which has the potential to mitigate bad reference issues we observed this year for some language pairs. Finally, we also study the connections between the magnitude of metric differences and their expected significance in human evaluation, which should help the community to better understand and adopt new metrics."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""FREDOM: Fairness Domain Adaptation Approach to Semantic Scene Understanding""?","Although Domain Adaptation in Semantic Scene Segmentation has shown impressive improvement in recent years, the fairness concerns in the domain adaptation have yet to be well defined and addressed. In addition, fairness is one of the most critical aspects when deploying the segmentation models into human-related real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving, as any unfair predictions could influence human safety. In this paper, we propose a novel Fairness Domain Adaptation (FREDOM) approach to semantic scene segmentation. In particular, from the proposed formulated fairness objective, a new adaptation framework will be introduced based on the fair treatment of class distributions. Moreover, to generally model the context of structural dependency, a new conditional structural constraint is introduced to impose the consistency of predicted segmentation. Thanks to the proposed Conditional Structure Network, the self-attention mechanism has sufficiently modeled the structural information of segmentation. Through the ablation studies, the proposed method has shown the performance improvement of the segmentation models and promoted fairness in the model predictions. The experimental results on the two standard benchmarks, i.e., SYNTHIA $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes and GTA5 $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes, have shown that our method achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance11The implementation of FREDOM is available at https://github.com/uark-cviu/FREDOM"

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for Parkinson’s disease (PD) under asleep and awake anesthesia state in 1-year postoperative follow-up. Methods Twenty-one PD patients were assigned to asleep group and 25 patients to awake group. Patients received bilateral STN-DBS under different anesthesia state. The PD participants were interviewed and assessed preoperatively and at 1-year postoperative follow-up. Results At 1-year follow-up, compared surgical coordinate in two groups, the left-side Y of asleep group showed more posterior than awake group (Y was-2.39 ± 0.23 in asleep group, −1.46 ± 0.22 in awake group, p = 0.007). Compared with preoperative OFF MED state, MDS-UPDRS III scores in OFF MED/OFF STIM state remained unchanged, while in OFF MED/ON STIM state were significantly improved in awake and asleep groups, yet without significant difference. Compared with preoperative ON MED state, MDS-UPDRS III scores in ON MED/OFF STIM, and ON MED/ON STIM state remained unchanged in both groups. In non-motor outcomes, PSQI, HAMD, and HAMA score significantly improved in asleep group compared to awake group at 1-year follow-up (PSQI, HAMD, and HAMA score in 1-year follow-up were 9.81 ± 4.43; 10.00 ± 5.80; 5.71 ± 4.75 in awake group, 6.64 ± 4.14; 5.32 ± 3.78; 3.76 ± 3.87 in asleep group, p = 0.009; 0.008; 0.015, respectively), while there was no significant difference in PDQ-39, NMSS, ESS, PDSS score, and cognitive function. Anesthesia methods was significantly associated with improvement of HAMA and HAMD score (p = 0.029; 0.002, respectively). No difference in LEDD, stimulation parameters and adverse events was observed between two groups. Discussion Asleep STN-DBS may be considered a good alternative method for PD patients. It is largely consistent with awake STN-DBS in motor symptoms and safety. Yet, it showed higher improvement in terms of mood and sleep compared to awake group at 1-year follow-up."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""TRPML1 as a potential therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer: a review""?","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most refractory subtype of breast cancer, and effective treatments are urgently needed owing to its poor prognosis. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, alone or in combination, are the leading choices for TNBC therapy. Although promising approaches and procedures have emerged, several challenges, such as off-target effects, drug resistance, and severe side effects, remain to be addressed. Recently, transient receptor potential channel mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) has attracted the attention of researchers because its expression has been implicated in numerous diseases, including cancer. TRPML1 regulates biological events and signaling pathways, including autophagic flux, exocytosis, ionic homeostasis, and lysosomal biogenesis, all contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. TRPML1 also functions as a building block for cancer cell growth, mitogenic signaling, priming tissues for metastasis, and activation of transcriptional programs, processes involved in several malignant tumors. This review provides an overview of breast cancer epidemiology and diagnostic techniques and then discusses the existing therapeutics. Additionally, we elaborate on the development of, and associated challenges to, TNBC diagnostics and treatment and the feasibility of TRPML1 as a therapeutic target for TNBC."

In this work, we instead propose a ST/MT multi-tasking framework with hard parameter sharing in which all model parameters are shared cross-modally. Our method reduces the speech-text modality gap via a pre-processing stage which converts speech and text inputs into two discrete token sequences of similar length -- this allows models to indiscriminately process both modalities simply using a joint vocabulary. With experiments on MuST-C, we demonstrate that our multi-tasking framework improves attentional encoder-decoder, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), transducer, and joint CTC/attention models by an average of +0.5 BLEU without any external MT data. Further, we show that this framework incorporates external MT data, yielding +0.8 BLEU, and also improves transfer learning from pre-trained textual models, yielding +1.8 BLEU."

Given the growth of publicly available data, finding the right dataset to use is increasingly difficult.

We operationalize the task of recommending datasets given a short natural language description of a research idea, to help people find relevant datasets for their needs. Dataset recommendation poses unique challenges as an information retrieval problem; datasets are hard to directly index for search and there are no corpora readily available for this task. To facilitate this task, we build the DataFinder Dataset which consists of a larger automatically-constructed training set (17.5K queries) and a smaller expert-annotated evaluation set (392 queries). Using this data, we compare various information retrieval algorithms on our test set and present a superior bi-encoder retriever for text-based dataset recommendation. This system, trained on the DataFinder Dataset, finds more relevant search results than existing third-party dataset search engines. To encourage progress on dataset recommendation, we release our dataset and models to the public."

A pseudo client visited some pharmacies to request the delivery of certain antibiotics and clinical scenarios were simulated to assess the attitudes and practices of professionals. Investigative staff visited 55 pharmacies and requested either amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin or ceftriaxone without providing a prescription or any other justification for the request. The frequencies of antibiotics dispensed without prescription during the visit of the pseudo-client were Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid cp (100%), Gentamycin 80 mg inj (60%), Ciprofloxacin 500 mg cp (72, 73%), and Ceftriaxone 1 g inj (58,18%). In the diarrhea scenario, only 4% of the pharmacies visited offered oral rehydration. For the bronchopulmonary clinical case, the most proposed antibiotics were: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (50%), Amoxicillin (28.57%) and Azithromycin (21.43%).

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Experimental Study on Secondary Anchorage Bond Performance of Residual Stress after Corrosion Fracture at Ends of Prestressed Steel Strands""?","In order to explore the secondary bond anchorage performance between prestressed tendons and concrete after the fracture of steel strands in post-tensioned, prestressed concrete (PPC) beams, a total of seven post-tensioned, prestressed concrete specimens with a size of 3 × 7ϕ15.2 mm were constructed firstly, and the steel strands at the anchorage end were subjected to corrosion fracture. Then, the pull-out test of the specimens was conducted to explore the secondary anchorage bond mechanism of the residual stress of prestressed tendons experiencing local fracture. Moreover, the influences of factors such as the embedded length, release-tensioning speed, concrete strength, and stirrup configuration on anchorage bond performance were analyzed. Finally, the test results were further verified via finite element analysis. The results show that the failure of pull-out specimens under different parameters can be divided into two types: bond anchorage failure induced by the entire pull-out of steel strands and material failure triggered by the rupture of steel strands. The bond anchorage failure mechanism between steel strands and the concrete was revealed by combining the failure characteristics and pull-out load–slippage relation curves. The bond strength between prestressed steel strands and concrete can be enhanced by increasing the embedded length of steel strands, elevating the concrete strength grade, and enlarging the diameter of stirrups so that the specimens are turned from bond anchorage failure into material failure."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Learning Performance-Improving Code Edits""?","The waning of Moore's Law has shifted the focus of the tech industry towards alternative methods for continued performance gains. While optimizing compilers are a standard tool to help increase program efficiency, programmers continue to shoulder much responsibility in crafting and refactoring code with better performance characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to suggest functionally correct, performance improving code edits. We hypothesize that language models can suggest such edits in ways that would be impractical for static analysis alone. We investigate these questions by curating a large-scale dataset of Performance-Improving Edits, PIE. PIE contains trajectories of programs, where a programmer begins with an initial, slower version and iteratively makes changes to improve the program's performance. We use PIE to evaluate and improve the capacity of large language models. Specifically, use examples from PIE to fine-tune multiple variants of CODEGEN, a billion-scale Transformer-decoder model. Additionally, we use examples from PIE to prompt OpenAI's CODEX using a few-shot prompting. By leveraging PIE, we find that both CODEX and CODEGEN can generate performance-improving edits, with speedups of more than 2.5x for over 25% of the programs, for C++ and Python, even after the C++ programs were compiled using the O3 optimization level. Crucially, we show that PIE allows CODEGEN, an open-sourced and 10x smaller model than CODEX, to match the performance of CODEX on this challenging task. Overall, this work opens new doors for creating systems and methods that can help programmers write efficient code."

We present the semantic notion of agentivity as a case study for probing such interactions. We created a novel evaluation dataset by utilitizing the unique linguistic properties of a subset of optionally transitive English verbs. This dataset was used to prompt varying sizes of three model classes to see if they are sensitive to agentivity at the lexical level, and if they can appropriately employ these word-level priors given a specific syntactic context. Overall, GPT-3 text-davinci-003 performs extremely well across all experiments, outperforming all other models tested by far. In fact, the results are even better correlated with human judgements than both syntactic and semantic corpus statistics. This suggests that LMs may potentially serve as more useful tools for linguistic annotation, theory testing, and discovery than select corpora for certain tasks."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Smaller Language Models are Better Black-box Machine-Generated Text Detectors""?","With the advent of fluent generative language models that can produce convincing utterances very similar to those written by humans, distinguishing whether a piece of text is machine-generated or human-written becomes more challenging and more important, as such models could be used to spread misinformation, fake news, fake reviews and to mimic certain authors and figures. To this end, there have been a slew of methods proposed to detect machine-generated text. Most of these methods need access to the logits of the target model or need the ability to sample from the target. One such black-box detection method relies on the observation that generated text is locally optimal under the likelihood function of the generator, while human-written text is not. We find that overall, smaller and partially-trained models are better universal text detectors: they can more precisely detect text generated from both small and larger models. Interestingly, we find that whether the detector and generator were trained on the same data is not critically important to the detection success. For instance the OPT-125M model has an AUC of 0.81 in detecting ChatGPT generations, whereas a larger model from the GPT family, GPTJ-6B, has AUC of 0.45."

In experiments on a newly collected, publicly available, year-long Twitter dataset exhibiting temporal distribution shift, our method improves by 64% over the best static parametric baseline while avoiding costly gradient-based re-training.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Why do Nearest Neighbor Language Models Work?""?","Language models (LMs) compute the probability of a text by sequentially computing a representation of an already-seen context and using this representation to predict the next word. Currently, most LMs calculate these representations through a neural network consuming the immediate previous context. However recently, retrieval-augmented LMs have shown to improve over standard neural LMs, by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore, in addition to their standard, parametric, next-word prediction. In this paper, we set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and specifically why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better than standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component retrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally trained on. To this end, we perform a careful analysis of the various dimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these dimensions one by one. Empirically, we identify three main reasons why kNN-LM performs better than standard LMs: using a different input representation for predicting the next tokens, approximate kNN search, and the importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution. Further, we incorporate these insights into the model architecture or the training procedure of the standard parametric LM, improving its results without the need for an explicit retrieval component.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Learning to Generate Equitable Text in Dialogue from Biased Training Data""?","The ingrained principles of fairness in a dialogue system’s decision-making process and generated responses are crucial for user engagement, satisfaction, and task achievement. Absence of equitable and inclusive principles can hinder the formation of common ground, which in turn negatively impacts the overall performance of the system. For example, misusing pronouns in a user interaction may cause ambiguity about the intended subject. Yet, there is no comprehensive study of equitable text generation in dialogue. Aptly, in this work, we use theories of computational learning to study this problem. We provide formal definitions of equity in text generation, and further, prove formal connections between learning human-likeness and learning equity: algorithms for improving equity ultimately reduce to algorithms for improving human-likeness (on augmented data). With this insight, we also formulate reasonable conditions under which text generation algorithms can learn to generate equitable text without any modifications to the biased training data on which they learn. To exemplify our theory in practice, we look at a group of algorithms for the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue game and, using this example, test our theory empirically. Our theory accurately predicts relative-performance of multiple algorithms in generating equitable text as measured by both human and automated evaluation."

On the Need for Contextual Models and Evaluations for Stylistic Rewriting""?","Most existing stylistic text rewriting methods and evaluation metrics operate on a sentence level, but ignoring the broader context of the text can lead to preferring generic, ambiguous, and incoherent rewrites. In this paper, we investigate integrating the preceding textual context into both the $\textit{rewriting}$ and $\textit{evaluation}$ stages of stylistic text rewriting, and introduce a new composite contextual evaluation metric $\texttt{CtxSimFit}$ that combines similarity to the original sentence with contextual cohesiveness. We comparatively evaluate non-contextual and contextual rewrites in formality, toxicity, and sentiment transfer tasks. Our experiments show that humans significantly prefer contextual rewrites as more fitting and natural over non-contextual ones, yet existing sentence-level automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, SBERT) correlate poorly with human preferences ($\rho$=0--0.3). In contrast, human preferences are much better reflected by both our novel $\texttt{CtxSimFit}$ ($\rho$=0.7--0.9) as well as proposed context-infused versions of common metrics ($\rho$=0.4--0.7). Overall, our findings highlight the importance of integrating context into the generation and especially the evaluation stages of stylistic text rewriting."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Language Models Get a Gender Makeover: Mitigating Gender Bias with Few-Shot Data Interventions""?","Societal biases present in pre-trained large language models are a critical issue as these models have been shown to propagate biases in countless downstream applications, rendering them unfair towards specific groups of people. Since large-scale retraining of these models from scratch is both time and compute-expensive, a variety of approaches have been previously proposed that de-bias a pre-trained model. While the majority of current state-of-the-art debiasing methods focus on changes to the training regime, in this paper, we propose data intervention strategies as a powerful yet simple technique to reduce gender bias in pre-trained models. Specifically, we empirically show that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 debiased (intervened) training examples, the tendency to favor any gender is significantly reduced. Since our proposed method only needs a few training examples, we argue that our few-shot de-biasing approach is highly feasible and practical. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our de-biasing technique performs better than competitive state-of-the-art baselines with minimal loss in language modeling ability."

Here, we develop an experimental proteomic method called VESPA (Variant Enabled SILAC Proteomic Analysis) to test the hypothesis that Drosophila male seminal fluid RNA is translated by females. We find strong evidence for 67 male-derived, female-translated proteins (mdFTPs) in female lower reproductive tracts at six hours postmating, many with predicted functions relevant to reproduction. Gene knockout experiments indicate that genes coding for mdFTPs play diverse roles in postmating interactions, with effects on fertilization efficiency, and the formation and persistence of the insemination reaction mass, a trait hypothesized to be involved in sexual conflict. These findings advance our understanding of reproduction by revealing a novel mechanism of postmating molecular interactions between the sexes that strengthens and extends male influences on reproductive outcomes in previously unrecognized ways. Given the diverse species known to carry RNA in seminal fluid, this discovery has broad significance for understanding molecular mechanisms of cooperation and conflict during reproduction."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""A Multilabel Learning-Based Automatic Annotation Method for Semantic Roles in English Text""?","With the increasing amount of textual information in the Internet, smart semantic comprehension is a practical demand. Among, automatic annotation for semantic roles remains the fundamental part for effective semantic comprehension. Although machine learning-based methods had received much attention in recent years, they mostly divided each sentences into separable parts for calculation. To deal with such challenge, this paper introduces multilabel learning to propose a novel automatic annotation method for semantic roles in English text. In the semantic representation of words, the method uses convolutional neural networks to extract local feature information of words from the character level. Such design can alleviate the problem of inconspicuous semantic features caused by random initialization of unregistered words. Secondly, in the process of implication recognition, by combining the interactive attention mechanism to construct a capsule for each implication relation separately, the recognition of the final implication relation is completed in the way of categorical learning. At last, some experiments are conducted on real-world data to verify the proposed method with being compared with several typical relevant methods. The obtained results show that the proposal achieves better Macro-F1 results on eight datasets compared to seven algorithms. Besides, the proposal also performs better than others in the sensitivity testing, as its performance can remain stable with the increase of noise input. In summary, the proposal can achieve good results and show strong capability in semantic role labeling tasks."

Folic acid (FA) was employed as a ligand to target cancer cells actively. The nanomicelles are biocompatible and acid-sensitive drug carriers. Magnetic field-responsive nanoparticles enable moderately controlled magnetothermal therapy of tumors regardless of tumor location. The pH/magnetic field dual-responsive nanomicelles shed their PEG layer in response to tumor tissue acidity and react to magnetic fields through magnetothermal effects. Results In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the nanomicelles could efficiently target cancer cells, release drugs in response to pH changes, and enhance drug uptake through magnetothermal effects. Discussion The dual-responsive magnetic nanomicelles are expected to enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of chemo/magnetothermal synergistic therapy."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Assessment of quality of life after upper extremity transplantation: Framework for patient-reported outcome scale domains""?","Upper extremity transplantation offers the promise of restored function and regained quality of life (QOL) for individuals who have sustained hand or arm amputation. However, a major challenge for this procedure becoming an accessible treatment option for patients is the lack of standard measures to document benefits to QOL. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures are well-suited for this kind of intervention, where the perspective of the patient is central to defining treatment success. To date, qualitative work with experts, clinicians, and patients has been used to identify the most important domains of QOL for PRO item development. Specifically, our group’s qualitative work has identified several domains of QOL that are unique to individuals who have received upper extremity transplants, which are distinct from topics covered by existing PRO measures. These include emotional and social aspects of upper extremity transplant, such as Expectations and Perceived Outcomes, Integration and Assimilation of Transplant, Fitting in, and Post-Surgical Challenges and Complications. The broad topic of Satisfaction with Transplant was subdivided into three subtopics: Function, Sensation, and Aesthetics. Satisfaction with Sensation was also identified as a unique domain not evaluated by existing PRO measures. This report operationalizes these eight QOL domains by presenting scoping definitions. This manuscript describes the work that has been completed for domain characterization as an early step toward developing standardized PRO measures to evaluate these important outcomes specific to upper extremity transplantation."

This is a foundational challenge for robots to be useful assistants in human environments, because it involves tackling sub-problems from across robotics: perception, language understanding, navigation, and manipulation are all essential to OVMM. In addition, integration of the solutions to these sub-problems poses its own substantial challenges. To drive research in this area, we introduce the HomeRobot OVMM benchmark, where an agent navigates household environments to grasp novel objects and place them on target receptacles. HomeRobot has two components: a simulation component, which uses a large and diverse curated object set in new, high-quality multi-room home environments; and a real-world component, providing a software stack for the low-cost Hello Robot Stretch to encourage replication of real-world experiments across labs.

Despite this, MBR is not frequently applied in NLP works, and knowledge of the method itself is limited. We first provide an introduction to the method and the recent literature. We show that several recent methods that do not reference MBR can be written as special cases of MBR; this reformulation provides additional theoretical justification for the performance of these methods, explaining some results that were previously only empirical.

Inpainting and outpainting, also referred to as I-step and O-step, allow our method to gradually advance the target segmentation mask toward the ground truth without supervision or training. PaintSeg can be configured to work with a variety of prompts, e.g. coarse masks, boxes, scribbles, and points.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Characterization of Asphaltene Deposition Behavior in Diluted Heavy Oil under High-Pressure Conditions""?","Some oil wells in the Tahe oilfield have been reported to produce extremely heavy oil due to asphaltene deposition. To enhance the flow of crude oil through the wellbore, engineers adopted the use of light oil from nearby wells to dissolve the heavy crude in the wells’ sections to maximize recovery from the Tahe oilfield. However, this mixing has led to the problem of accelerated asphaltene deposition, which often blocks the wellbore in the process. In this research, the factors that influence the stability of diluted heavy oil, temperature, and mixing ratio on asphaltene deposition characteristics under high pressure are studied using a high-temperature and high-pressure crude oil flow property experimental device based on the differential pressure method. The results under high pressure show that the initial deposition pressure of asphaltene decreases as the experimental temperature increases. With an increase in the mixing light oil ratio, the initial deposition pressure of diluted heavy oil increases, and the deposition trend of asphaltene strengthens. The asphaltene accumulation and deposition will be aggravated by filling quartz sand and pipe diameter changes. The research here is helpful to understand the deposition characteristics of asphaltene during the production of diluted heavy oil. It offers significant guidance in the prevention and control of asphaltene precipitation in heavy oil wells."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Wavefront shaping improves the transparency of the scattering media: a review""?","Abstract. Significance Wavefront shaping (WFS) can compensate for distortions by optimizing the wavefront of the input light or reversing the transmission matrix of the media. It is a promising field of research. A thorough understanding of principles and developments of WFS is important for optical research. Aim To provide insight into WFS for researchers who deal with scattering in biomedicine, imaging, and optical communication, our study summarizes the basic principles and methods of WFS and reviews recent progress. Approach The basic principles, methods of WFS, and the latest applications of WFS in focusing, imaging, and multimode fiber (MMF) endoscopy are described. The practical challenges and prospects of future development are also discussed. Results Data-driven learning-based methods are opening up new possibilities for WFS. High-resolution imaging through MMFs can support small-diameter endoscopy in the future. Conclusion The rapid development of WFS over the past decade has shown that the best solution is not to avoid scattering but to find ways to correct it or even use it. WFS with faster speed, more optical modes, and more modulation degrees of freedom will continue to drive exciting developments in various fields."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Clinicopathological Characteristics of NRG1 Fusion-Positive Solid Tumors in Korean Patients.""?","Purpose NRG1 gene fusion is a potentially actionable oncogenic driver. The oncoprotein binds to ERBB3-ERBB2 heterodimers and activates downstream signaling, supporting a therapeutic approach for inhibiting ERBB3/ERBB2. However, the frequency and clinicopathological features of solid tumors harboring NRG1 fusions in Korean patients remain largely unknown. Materials and Methods We reviewed archival data from next-generation sequencing panel tests conducted at a single institution, specifically selecting patients with in-frame fusions that preserved the functional domain. The clinicopathological characteristics of patients harboring NRG1 fusions were retrospectively reviewed. Results Out of 8,148 patients, NRG1 fusions were identified in 22 patients (0.27%). The average age of the patients was 59 years (range, 32-78 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.2. The lung was the most frequently observed primary site (n=13), followed by the pancreaticobiliary tract (n=3), gastrointestinal tract (n=2, stomach and rectum each), ovary (n=2), breast (n=1), and soft tissue (n=1). Histologically, all tumors demonstrated adenocarcinoma histology, with the exception of one case of sarcoma. CD74 (n=8) and SLC3A2 (n=4) were the most frequently identified fusion partners. Dominant features included the presence of fewer than three co-occurring genetic alterations, a low tumor mutation burden, and low programmed death-ligand 1 expression. Various clinical responses were observed in patients with NRG1 fusions. Conclusion Despite the rarity of NRG1 fusions in Korean patients with solid tumors, identification through next-generation sequencing enables the possibility of new targeted therapies."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Antigenic drift and subtype interference shape A(H3N2) epidemic dynamics in the United States""?","Influenza viruses continually evolve new antigenic variants, through mutations in epitopes of their major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Antigenic drift potentiates the reinfection of previously infected individuals, but the contribution of this process to variability in annual epidemics is not well understood. Here we link influenza A(H3N2) virus evolution to regional epidemic dynamics in the United States during 1997-2019. We integrate phenotypic measures of HA antigenic drift and sequence-based measures of HA and NA fitness to infer antigenic and genetic distances between viruses circulating in successive seasons. We estimate the magnitude, severity, timing, transmission rate, age-specific patterns, and subtype dominance of each regional outbreak and find that genetic distance based on broad sets of epitope sites is the strongest evolutionary predictor of A(H3N2) virus epidemiology. Increased HA and NA epitope distance between seasons correlates with larger, more intense epidemics, higher transmission, greater A(H3N2) subtype dominance, and a greater proportion of cases in adults relative to children, consistent with increased population susceptibility. Based on random forest models, A(H1N1) incidence impacts A(H3N2) epidemics to a greater extent than viral evolution, suggesting that subtype interference is a major driver of influenza A virus infection dynamics, presumably via heterosubtypic cross-immunity."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Cytomegalovirus at the crossroads of immunosenescence and oncogenesis""?","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), whose genome is around 235 kb, is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that infects between 40% and 95% of the population. Though HCMV infection is commonly asymptomatic and leads to subtle clinical symptoms, it can promote robust immune responses and establish lifelong latency. In addition, in immunocompromised hosts, including individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplant recipients, and developing fetuses it can lead to severe diseases. Immunosenescence, well-defined as the alterations in the immune system, is linked mainly to aging and has been recently gathering considerable attention. Senescence was characterized by an elevated inflammation and hence considered a powerful contributor to “inflammaging” that is measured mainly by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as well as latent viral infections, for instance, cytomegalovirus (CMV). Inflammaging resulted in a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). HCMV is markedly associated with accelerated aging of the immune system as well as several age-associated diseases that accumulate and subsequently deteriorate the immune responses, thus have been linked to mortality, declined vaccine efficacy, serious diseases, and tumors in the elderly. HCMV triggers or exacerbates immunosenescence; on the other hand, the weakened immune responses and inflammaging favor viral reactivation and highlight the role of HCMV in aging as well as viral-associated tumors. HCMV reactivation resulting in sequential lytic and latent viral cycles could contribute to HCMV genomic variability. Besides the oncomodulatory role and transforming capacities of HCMV, the immune-privileged tumor microenvironment has been considered the main element in tumor progression and aggressiveness. Therefore, the interplay between HCMV, immunosenescence, and cancer will aid in discovering new therapeutic approaches that target HCMV and act as immune response boosters mainly to fight cancers of poor prognosis, particularly in the elderly population."

We evaluate both (1) intrinsic aspects of phonetic word embeddings, such as word retrieval and correlation with sound similarity, and (2) extrinsic performance on tasks such as rhyme and cognate detection and sound analogies. We hope our task suite will promote reproducibility and inspire future phonetic embedding research."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Towards Practical and Efficient Image-to-Speech Captioning with Vision-Language Pre-training and Multi-modal Tokens""?","In this paper, we propose methods to build a powerful and efficient Image-to-Speech captioning (Im2Sp) model. To this end, we start with importing the rich knowledge related to image comprehension and language modeling from a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model into Im2Sp. We set the output of the proposed Im2Sp as discretized speech units, i.e., the quantized speech features of a self-supervised speech model. The speech units mainly contain linguistic information while suppressing other characteristics of speech. This allows us to incorporate the language modeling capability of the pre-trained vision-language model into the spoken language modeling of Im2Sp. With the vision-language pre-training strategy, we set new state-of-the-art Im2Sp performances on two widely used benchmark databases, COCO and Flickr8k. Then, we further improve the efficiency of the Im2Sp model. Similar to the speech unit case, we convert the original image into image units, which are derived through vector quantization of the raw image. With these image units, we can drastically reduce the required data storage for saving image data to just 0.8% when compared to the original image data in terms of bits.

Our work explores the use of more abundant real-world data for building speech synthesizers. We train TTS systems using real-world speech from YouTube and podcasts. We observe the mismatch between training and inference alignments in mel-spectrogram based autoregressive models, leading to unintelligible synthesis, and demonstrate that learned discrete codes within multiple code groups effectively resolves this issue. We introduce our MQTTS system whose architecture is designed for multiple code generation and monotonic alignment, along with the use of a clean silence prompt to improve synthesis quality. We conduct ablation analyses to identify the efficacy of our methods. We show that MQTTS outperforms existing TTS systems in several objective and subjective measures."

In this paper, we investigate a novel way to obtain such an intent signal by leveraging resource pages associated with a particular task. We jointly model product interactions and resource page interactions to create a system which can recommend both products and resource pages to users. Our experiments consider the domain of home improvement product recommendation, where resource pages are DIY (do-it-yourself) project pages from Lowes.com. Each DIY page provides a list of tools, materials, and step-by-step instructions to complete a DIY project, such as building a deck, installing cabinets, and fixing a leaking pipe. We use this data as an indicator of the intended project, which is a natural high-level intent signal for home improvement shoppers. We then extend a state-of-the-art system to incorporate this new intent data, and show a significant improvement in the ability of the system to recommend products. We further demonstrate that our system can be used to successfully recommend DIY project pages to users. We have taken initial steps towards deploying our method for project recommendation in production on the Lowe’s website and for recommendations through marketing emails."

This data has been cleaned to remove biases. To understand the polarization we begin by showing results from some classical language models in Word2Vec and Doc2Vec.

In a second study, where 91 people who stutter recorded voice assistant commands and dictation, we quantify how dysfluencies impede performance in a consumer-grade speech recognition system.

Design: Retrospective cohort study of antifungal and antibiotic audits by a children’s hospital antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) from November 1, 2020, to October 31, 2022. Methods: Antimicrobial audit data were retrieved from the ASP data warehouse. We characterized antifungal PAF using descriptive statistics. We then compared the overall rates of PAF recommendation and recommendation acceptance between antifungals and antibiotics. We also compared the differences in antifungal and antibiotic PAF recommendation and acceptance rates across various factors, including infectious problem, medical service, and recommendation type. Results: Of 10,402 antimicrobial audits identified during the study period, 8,599 (83%) were for antibiotics and 1,803 (17%) were for antifungals. The highest antifungal recommendation rates were for liposomal amphotericin B, antifungals used for sepsis or respiratory tract infection, and antifungals prescribed in the cardiovascular intensive care unit. The rate of PAF recommendation was higher for antibiotics than for antifungals (29% vs 21%; P < .001); however, the rates of recommendation acceptance were similar. Recommendations to discontinue or for medication monitoring were more common for antifungals. Conclusions: Our analysis of antifungal PAF identified key opportunities to improve antifungal use, including the optimized use of specific agents and targeted use by certain medical services. Moreover, antifungal PAF, despite identifying fewer recommendations compared to antibiotic PAF, were associated with similarly high rates of acceptance, highlighting a promising opportunity for antifungal stewardship."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Latest results on searching for fractionally charged particles with the DAMPE experiment""?","The existence of fractionally charged particles (FCP) is foreseen in extensions of or beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Most of the previously conducted searches for FCPs in cosmic rays were based on experiments underground or at high altitudes. However, there have been few searches for FCPs in cosmic rays carried out in orbit other than AMS-01 flown by a space shuttle and BESS by a balloon at the top of the atmosphere. In this study, we conduct an FCP search in space based on on-orbit data obtained using the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite over a period of five years. Unlike underground experiments, which require an FCP energy of the order of hundreds of GeV, our FCP search starts at only a few GeV. An upper limit of 6 . 2 × 10 − 10 cm − 2 sr − 1 s − 1 is obtained for the flux. Our results demonstrate that DAMPE exhibits higher sensitivity than experiments of similar types by three orders of magnitude that more stringently restricts the conditions for the existence of FCP in primary cosmic rays."

That social interaction matters is recognized by any experimentalist who seeks to exclude its influence by studying individuals in isolation. On this view, interaction complicates cognition. Here, we explore the more radical stance that interaction co-constitutes cognition: that we benefit from looking beyond single minds toward cognition as a process involving interacting minds. All around the cognitive sciences, there are approaches that put interaction center stage. Their diverse and pluralistic origins may obscure the fact that collectively, they harbor insights and methods that can respecify foundational assumptions and fuel novel interdisciplinary work. What might the cognitive sciences gain from stronger interactional foundations? This represents, we believe, one of the key questions for the future. Writing as a transdisciplinary collective assembled from across the classic cognitive science hexagon and beyond, we highlight the opportunity for a figure-ground reversal that puts interaction at the heart of cognition.

A key question is to what extent their modelling assumptions affect the capabilities of ITSs to adapt to various scenarios when deployed in the real world. This work focuses on two simulators commonly used to train reinforcement learning (RL) agents for traffic applications, CityFlow and SUMO. A controlled virtual experiment varying driver behavior and simulation scale finds evidence against distributional equivalence in RL-relevant measures from these simulators, with the root mean squared error and KL divergence being significantly greater than 0 for all assessed measures. While granular real-world validation generally remains infeasible, these findings suggest that traffic simulators are not a deus ex machina for RL training: understanding the impacts of inter-simulator differences is necessary to train and deploy RL-based ITSs."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Efficient Sequence Transduction by Jointly Predicting Tokens and Durations""?","This paper introduces a novel Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks. TDT extends conventional RNN-Transducer architectures by jointly predicting both a token and its duration, i.e. the number of input frames covered by the emitted token. This is achieved by using a joint network with two outputs which are independently normalized to generate distributions over tokens and durations. During inference, TDT models can skip input frames guided by the predicted duration output, which makes them significantly faster than conventional Transducers which process the encoder output frame by frame. TDT models achieve both better accuracy and significantly faster inference than conventional Transducers on different sequence transduction tasks. TDT models for Speech Recognition achieve better accuracy and up to 2.82X faster inference than conventional Transducers. TDT models for Speech Translation achieve an absolute gain of over 1 BLEU on the MUST-C test compared with conventional Transducers, and its inference is 2.27X faster. In Speech Intent Classification and Slot Filling tasks, TDT models improve the intent accuracy by up to over 1% (absolute) over conventional Transducers, while running up to 1.28X faster. Our implementation of the TDT model will be open-sourced with the NeMo (https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) toolkit."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Plan, Eliminate, and Track - Language Models are Good Teachers for Embodied Agents""?","Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) capture procedural knowledge about the world. Recent work has leveraged LLM's ability to generate abstract plans to simplify challenging control tasks, either by action scoring, or action modeling (fine-tuning). However, the transformer architecture inherits several constraints that make it difficult for the LLM to directly serve as the agent: e.g. limited input lengths, fine-tuning inefficiency, bias from pre-training, and incompatibility with non-text environments. To maintain compatibility with a low-level trainable actor, we propose to instead use the knowledge in LLMs to simplify the control problem, rather than solving it. We propose the Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) framework. The Plan module translates a task description into a list of high-level sub-tasks. The Eliminate module masks out irrelevant objects and receptacles from the observation for the current sub-task. Finally, the Track module determines whether the agent has accomplished each sub-task. On the AlfWorld instruction following benchmark, the PET framework leads to a significant 15% improvement over SOTA for generalization to human goal specifications."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Read and Reap the Rewards: Learning to Play Atari with the Help of Instruction Manuals""?","High sample complexity has long been a challenge for RL. On the other hand, humans learn to perform tasks not only from interaction or demonstrations, but also by reading unstructured text documents, e.g., instruction manuals. Instruction manuals and wiki pages are among the most abundant data that could inform agents of valuable features and policies or task-specific environmental dynamics and reward structures. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ability to utilize human-written instruction manuals to assist learning policies for specific tasks should lead to a more efficient and better-performing agent. We propose the Read and Reward framework. Read and Reward speeds up RL algorithms on Atari games by reading manuals released by the Atari game developers. Our framework consists of a QA Extraction module that extracts and summarizes relevant information from the manual and a Reasoning module that evaluates object-agent interactions based on information from the manual. An auxiliary reward is then provided to a standard A2C RL agent, when interaction is detected. Experimentally, various RL algorithms obtain significant improvement in performance and training speed when assisted by our design."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Contextualized Networks Reveal Heterogeneous Transcriptomic Regulation in Tumors at Sample-Specific Resolution""?","Cancers are shaped by somatic mutations, microenvironment, and patient background, each altering gene expression and regulation in complex ways, resulting in heterogeneous cellular states and dynamics. Inferring gene regulatory network (GRN) models from expression data can help characterize this regulation-driven heterogeneity, but network inference requires many statistical samples, traditionally limiting GRNs to cluster-level analyses that ignore intra-cluster heterogeneity. We propose to move beyond cluster-based analyses by using contextualized learning, a multi-task learning paradigm which allows us to infer sample-specific models using phenotypic, molecular, and environmental information pertinent to the model, encoded as the model’s “context” to be conditioned on. We unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, Neighborhood) and estimate context-specific GRNs for 7997 tumors across 25 tumor types, with each network contextualized by copy number and driver mutation profiles, tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics. Contextualized GRNs provide a structured view of expression dynamics at sample-specific resolution, which reveal co-expression modules in correlation networks (CNs), as well as cliques and independent regulatory elements in Markov Networks (MNs) and Neighborhood Regression Networks (NNs). Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict GRNs for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation. Finally, contextualized networks enable GRN-based precision oncology, explaining known biomarkers in terms of network-mediated effects, and leading to novel subtypings for thyroid, brain, and gastrointestinal tumors that improve survival prognosis."

Pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) is highly expressed in HCC, suggesting it could play an important role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Here, we evaluated the impact of PTTG1 deficiency on HCC development using a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model and a hepatitis B virus regulatory X protein (HBx)-induced spontaneous HCC mouse model. PTTG1 deficiency significantly suppressed DEN- and HBx-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Mechanistically, PTTG1 promoted asparagine synthetase (ASNS) transcription by binding to its promoter, and asparagine levels were correspondingly increased. The elevated levels of asparagine subsequently activated the mTOR pathway to facilitate HCC progression. In addition, asparaginase treatment reversed the proliferation induced by PTTG1 overexpression. Furthermore, HBx promoted ASNS and asparagine metabolism by upregulating PTTG1 expression. Overall, PTTG1 is involved in the reprogramming of asparagine metabolism to promote HCC progression and may serve as a therapeutic and diagnostic target for HCC."

We propose DSR-LM, a Differentiable Symbolic Reasoning framework where pre-trained LMs govern the perception of factual knowledge, and a symbolic module performs deductive reasoning. In contrast to works that rely on hand-crafted logic rules, our differentiable symbolic reasoning framework efficiently learns weighted rules and applies semantic loss to further improve LMs. DSR-LM is scalable, interpretable, and allows easy integration of prior knowledge, thereby supporting extensive symbolic programming to robustly derive a logical conclusion. The results of our experiments suggest that DSR-LM improves the logical reasoning abilities of pre-trained language models, resulting in a significant increase in accuracy of over 20% on deductive reasoning benchmarks.

The challenge comprises a research track focused on applying ML-SUPERB to specific multilingual subjects, a Challenge Track for model submissions, and a New Language Track where language resource researchers can contribute and evaluate their low-resource language data in the context of the latest progress in multilingual speech recognition. The challenge garnered 12 model submissions and 54 language corpora, resulting in a comprehensive benchmark encompassing 154 languages. The findings indicate that merely scaling models is not the definitive solution for multilingual speech tasks, and a variety of speech/voice types present significant challenges in multilingual speech processing."

To enhance the accuracy and preparedness for extreme weather events, this study explores the potential of using expert crowdsourcing in storm forecasting research through the application of stigmergic collaboration. We present the development and implementation of an expert Crowdsourcing for Semantic Annotation of Atmospheric Phenomena (eCSAAP) system, designed to leverage the collective knowledge and experience of meteorological experts. Through a participatory co-creation process, we iteratively developed a web-based annotation tool capable of capturing multi-faceted insights from weather data and generating visualizations for expert crowdsourcing campaigns. In this context, this article investigates the intrinsic coordination among experts engaged in crowdsourcing tasks focused on the semantic annotation of extreme weather events. The study brings insights about the behavior of expert crowds by considering the cognitive biases and highlighting the impact of existing annotations on the quality of data gathered from the crowd and the collective knowledge generated. The insights regarding the crowdsourcing dynamics, particularly stigmergy, offer a promising starting point for utilizing stigmergic collaboration as an effective coordination mechanism for weather experts in crowdsourcing platforms but also in other domains requiring expertise-driven collective intelligence."

Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each game test allows us to analyze each capability separately. SmartPlay serves not only as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM agents but also as a road-map for identifying gaps in current methodologies.

As far as energy efficiency is concerned, optimization strategies often result from the analysis of monitored data by a specialist, which slows down both decision making and implementation. Aware of this problem, this project arises, in which a complementary platform to the BMS systems is developed to provide them with greater intelligence. For its design, the Puerta del Hierro Hospital in Madrid has been taken as a pilot case, from the data captured by its own BMS and using the 6 SIGMA methodology, algorithms have been developed capable of optimizing the production systems themselves, thus helping to make up for the weaknesses in the operation of the systems and reducing energy consumption, minimizing the environmental impact and allowing to obtain the maximum performance of its assets. The platform uses the information gathered by the BMS and weather forecasts to predict a building's energy demand and, based on this, optimize energy production at any given moment.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Online Active Learning For Sound Event Detection""?","Data collection and annotation is a laborious, time-consuming prerequisite for supervised machine learning tasks. Online Active Learning (OAL) is a paradigm that addresses this issue by simultaneously minimizing the amount of annotation required to train a classifier and adapting to changes in the data over the duration of the data collection process. Prior work has indicated that fluctuating class distributions and data drift are still common problems for OAL. This work presents new loss functions that address these challenges when OAL is applied to Sound Event Detection (SED). Experimental results from the SONYC dataset and two Voice-Type Discrimination (VTD) corpora indicate that OAL can reduce the time and effort required to train SED classifiers by a factor of 5 for SONYC, and that the new methods presented here successfully resolve issues present in existing OAL methods."

The study uses a naturalistic face-to-face dataset annotated for natural language turns, conversational strategies, tutoring strategies, and nonverbal behaviors. These elements are processed into a vector representation of the previous turns, which serves as input to several machine learning models, including MLP and LSTM. The results show that embedding layers, capturing the semantic information of the previous turns, significantly improves the model’s performance. Additionally, the study provides insights into the importance of various features, such as interpersonal rapport and nonverbal behaviors, in predicting hedges by using Shapley values for feature explanation. We discover that the eye gaze of both the tutor and the tutee has a significant impact on hedge prediction. We further validate this observation through a follow-up ablation study."

However, its effect on breast cancer (BRCA) is unclear. Objective The objective of this study is to explore the important clinical significance of cuproptosis genes and to provide a new idea for guiding the personalized immunotherapy strategy of BRCA patients. Materials and Methods We collected cuproptosis genes from published work. The gene alteration, differential expression, and prognostic value of cuproptosis genes were explored in BRCA based on TCGA database. We identified two subtypes (clusters A and B) by performing unsupervised clustering. The difference between two clusters was deeply explored, including clinical features, differential expressed genes (DEGs), pathways, and immune cell infiltration. Based on the DEGs between two clusters, a cuproptosis score was constructed and its predictive capability for overall survival of BRCA patients was validated. Results and Discussion Patients with high cuproptosis score have worse survival status, with an increased infiltration level of most immune cells. Further analysis suggested that BRCA patients with high cuproptosis score may be sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. Conclusion Our findings may improve our understanding of cuproptosis in BRCA and may distinguish patients suitable for ICI treatment."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Text Conditional Alt-Text Generation for Twitter Images""?","In this work we present an approach for generating alternative text (or alt-text) descriptions for images shared on social media, specifically Twitter. This task is more than just a special case of image captioning, as alt-text is both more literally descriptive and context-specific. Also critically, images posted to Twitter are often accompanied by user-written text that despite not necessarily describing the image may provide useful context that if properly lever-aged can be informative – e.g. the tweet may name an uncommon object in the image that the model has not previously seen. We address this with a CLIP prefix model that extracts an embedding of the image and passes it to a mapping network that outputs a short sequence in word embedding space, or a “prefix”, to which we also concatenate the text from the tweet itself. This lets the model condition on both visual and textual information from the post. The combined multimodal prefix is then fed as a prompt to a pretrained language model which autore-gressively completes the sequence to generate the alt-text. While prior work has used similar methods for captioning, ours is the first to our knowledge that incorporates textual information from the associated social media post into the prefix as well, and we further demonstrate through ablations that utility of these two information sources stacks. We put forward a new dataset scraped from Twitter and evaluate on it across a variety of automated metrics as well as human evaluation, and show that our approach of conditioning on both tweet text and visual information significantly outperforms prior work."

We use acoustic properties that are correlated to emotion like pitch, intensity, speech rate, and articulation rate to automatically generate prompts i.e. 'acoustic prompts'. We use a contrastive learning objective to map speech to their respective acoustic prompts. We evaluate our model on Emotion Audio Retrieval and Speech Emotion Recognition. Our results show that the acoustic prompts significantly improve the model's performance in EAR, in various Precision@K metrics.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena""?","Evaluating large language model (LLM) based chat assistants is challenging due to their broad capabilities and the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in measuring human preferences. To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional benchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA and Vicuna.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Automation of Language Sample Analysis""?","Purpose: A major barrier to the wider use of language sample analysis (LSA) is the fact that transcription is very time intensive. Methods that can reduce the required time and effort could help in promoting the use of LSA for clinical practice and research. Method: This article describes an automated pipeline, called Batchalign, that takes raw audio and creates full transcripts in Codes for the Human Analysis of Talk (CHAT) transcription format, complete with utterance- and word-level time alignments and morphosyntactic analysis. The pipeline only requires major human intervention for final checking. It combines a series of existing tools with additional novel reformatting processes. The steps in the pipeline are (a) automatic speech recognition, (b) utterance tokenization, (c) automatic corrections, (d) speaker ID assignment, (e) forced alignment, (f) user adjustments, and (g) automatic morphosyntactic and profiling analyses. Results: For work with recordings from adults with language disorders, six major results were obtained: (a) The word error rate was between 2.4% for controls and 3.4% for patients, (b) utterance tokenization accuracy was at the level reported for speakers without language disorders, (c) word-level diarization accuracy was at 93% for control participants and 83% for participants with language disorders, (d) utterance-level diarization accuracy based on word-level diarization was high, (e) adherence to CHAT format was fully accurate, and (f) human transcriber time was reduced by up to 75%. Conclusion: The pipeline dramatically shortens the time gap between data collection and data analysis and provides an output superior to that typically generated by human transcribers."

On the other hand, human perception, which DNNs are supposed to emulate, is highly robust to such perturbations, indicating that there may be certain features of the human perception that make it robust but are not represented in the current class of DNNs. One such feature is that the activity of biological neurons is correlated and the structure of this correlation tends to be rather rigid over long spans of times, even if it hampers performance and learning. We hypothesize that integrating such constraints on the activations of a DNN would improve its adversarial robustness, and, to test this hypothesis, we have developed the Self-Consistent Activation (SCA) layer, which comprises of neurons whose activations are consistent with each other, as they conform to a fixed, but learned, covariability pattern. When evaluated on image and sound recognition tasks, the models with a SCA layer achieved high accuracy, and exhibited significantly greater robustness than multi-layer perceptron models to state-of-the-art Auto-PGD adversarial attacks \textit{without being trained on adversarially perturbed data"

Unless using shallow fusion, end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models require architecture modifications or additional training schemes to use text-only data. Inspired by recent advances in decoder-only language models (LMs), such as GPT-3 and PaLM adopted for speech-processing tasks, we propose using a decoder-only architecture for ASR with simple text augmentation. To provide audio information, encoder features compressed by CTC prediction are used as prompts for the decoder, which can be regarded as refining CTC prediction using the decoder-only model. Because the decoder architecture is the same as an autoregressive LM, it is simple to enhance the model by leveraging external text data with LM training. An experimental comparison using LibriSpeech and Switchboard shows that our proposed models with text augmentation training reduced word error rates from ordinary CTC by 0.3% and 1.4% on LibriSpeech test-clean and testother set, respectively, and 2.9% and 5.0% on Switchboard and CallHome. The proposed model had advantage on computational efficiency compared with conventional encoder-decoder ASR models with a similar parameter setup, and outperformed them on the LibriSpeech 100h and Switchboard training scenarios."

To achieve scalability when dealing with large-scale knowledge graphs, recent works formulate KGC as a sequence-to-sequence process, where the incomplete triplet (input) and the missing entity (output) are both verbalized as text sequences. However, inference with these methods relies solely on the model parameters for implicit reasoning and neglects the use of KG itself, which limits the performance since the model lacks the capacity to memorize a vast number of triplets. To tackle this issue, we introduce ReSKGC, a Retrieval-enhanced Seq2seq KGC model, which selects semantically relevant triplets from the KG and uses them as evidence to guide output generation with explicit reasoning.

Teicoplanin concentrations were detected, and patients’ clinical data were recorded. PPK analysis was performed using a non-linear, mixed-effect modeling approach. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate currently recommended dosing and other dosage regimens. The optimal dosing regimens were defined and compared by different pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, including trough concentration (Cmin), the ratio of 24-h area under the concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC0-24/MIC), as well as the probability of target attainment (PTA) and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) against MRSA. Results: A two-compartment model adequately described the data. The final model parameter estimates for clearance, central compartment volume of distribution, intercompartmental clearance and peripheral compartment volume were 1.03 L/h, 20.1 L, 3.12 L/h and 101 L, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was the only covariate that significantly affected teicoplanin clearance. Model-based simulations revealed that 3 or 5 loading doses of 12/15 mg/kg every 12 h followed by a maintenance dose of 12/15 mg/kg every 24 h–72 h for patients with different renal functions were required to achieve a target Cmin of 15 mg/L and a target AUC0-24/MIC of 610. For MRSA infections, PTAs and CFRs were not satisfactory for simulated regimens. Prolonging the dosing interval may be easier to achieve the target AUC0-24/MIC than reducing the unit dose for renal insufficient patients. Conclusion: A PPK model for teicoplanin in adult septic patients was successfully developed. Model-based simulations revealed that current standard doses may result in undertherapeutic Cmin and AUC, and a single dose of at least 12 mg/kg may be needed. AUC0-24/MIC should be preferred as the PK/PD indicator of teicoplanin, if AUC estimation is unavailable, in addition to routine detection of teicoplanin Cmin on Day 4, follow-up therapeutic drug monitoring at steady-state is recommended."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Hence, Socrates is mortal: A Benchmark for Natural Language Syllogistic Reasoning""?","Syllogistic reasoning, a typical form of deductive reasoning, is a critical capability widely required in natural language understanding tasks, such as text entailment and question answering. To better facilitate research on syllogis-tic reasoning, we develop a benchmark called S YLLO B ASE that differs from existing syllo-gistic datasets in three aspects: (1) Covering a complete taxonomy of syllogism reasoning patterns; (2) Containing both automatically and manually constructed samples; and (3) Involving both the generation and understanding tasks. We automatically construct 50k template-based syllogism samples by mining syllogism patterns from Wikidata and ConceptNet. To improve our dataset’s naturalness and challenge, we apply GPT-3 to paraphrase the template-based data and further manually rewrite 1,000 samples as the test set. State-of-the-art pre-trained language models can achieve the best generation ROUGE-L of 38.72 by T5 and the best multi-choice accuracy of 72.77% by RoBERTa on S YLLO B ASE , which indicates the great challenge of learning diverse syllo-gistic reasoning types on S YLLO B ASE .

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Synthetic biology open language (SBOL) version 3.1.0""?","Abstract Synthetic biology builds upon genetics, molecular biology, and metabolic engineering by applying engineering principles to the design of biological systems. When designing a synthetic system, synthetic biologists need to exchange information about multiple types of molecules, the intended behavior of the system, and actual experimental measurements. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology, following an open community process involving both bench scientists and scientific modelers and software developers, across academia, industry, and other institutions. This document describes SBOL 3.1.0, which improves on version 3.0.0 by including a number of corrections and clarifications as well as several other updates and enhancements. First, this version includes a complete set of validation rules for checking whether documents are valid SBOL 3. Second, the best practices section has been moved to an online repository that allows for more rapid and interactive of sharing these conventions. Third, it includes updates based upon six community approved enhancement proposals. Two enhancement proposals are related to the representation of an object’s namespace. In particular, the Namespace class has been removed and replaced with a namespace property on each class. Another enhancement is the generalization of the CombinatorialDeriviation class to allow direct use of Features and Measures. Next, the Participation class now allow Interactions to be participants to describe higher-order interactions. Another change is the use of Sequence Ontology terms for Feature orientation. Finally, this version of SBOL has generalized from using Unique Reference Identifiers (URIs) to Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) to support international character sets."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Water in Omphacite and Garnet From Pristine Xenolithic Eclogite: T‐X‐fO2 Controls, Retentivity, and Implications for Electrical Conductivity and Deep H2O Recycling""?","Kimberlite‐borne eclogite xenoliths having Precambrian oceanic crustal protoliths and entrained from ≥100 km depth can retain pristine geochemical features despite extended residence in the cratonic lithospheric mantle, making them valuable archives of deep chemical cycling including that of water. We determined, by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, structural OH contents in clinopyroxene and garnet from 15 unmetasomatized eclogite xenoliths. Calculated total c(H2O) is 100–510 wt.ppm for clinopyroxene and below detection (∼2 wt.ppm) to 200 wt.ppm for garnet, while garnet δ18O, determined by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry, ranges from +5.0‰ to +7.3‰, (similar to high‐ and low‐temperature seawater‐altered oceanic crust). Estimated electrical conductivity in pristine eclogites increases with temperature (i.e., depth for conductive geotherms), while clinopyroxene‐garnet H2O partition coefficients decrease with increasing temperature and garnet grossular component (i.e., Ca#), similar to other incompatible components. Various considerations suggest the retention of primary H2O in the samples, likely occurring in km‐sized pods of coarse‐grained eclogite. High Al2O3 in clinopyroxene as omphacite component, stabilized during high‐pressure metamorphism, facilitates H2O uptake. Therefore, the high bulk c(H2O) estimated for samples with plagioclase‐rich, deep crustal protoliths (median 290 wt.ppm) may indicate an interaction with fluids expelled at depth from serpentinites. The c(H2O) of ancient and modern subducted bulk oceanic crust (∼220–240 wt.ppm) are similar, suggesting constant mantle ingassing since at least 3 Ga ago. This places constraints on factors, such as mantle temperatures, that determine the efficiency of deep water cycling."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Paradoxical Induction of ALOX15/15B by Cortisol in Human Amnion Fibroblasts: Implications for Inflammatory Responses of the Fetal Membranes at Parturition""?","Inflammation of the fetal membranes is an indispensable event of parturition, with increasing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis as one of the ultimate products that prime labor onset. In addition to PGE2, the fetal membranes also boast a large capacity for cortisol regeneration. It is intriguing how increased PGE2 synthesis is achieved in the presence of increasing amounts of classical anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids in the fetal membranes at parturition. 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE) synthesized by lipoxygenase 15/15B (ALOX15/15B) has been shown to enhance inflammation-induced PGE2 synthesis in amnion fibroblasts. Here, we examined whether glucocorticoids could induce ALOX15/15B expression and 15(S)-HETE production to promote PGE2 synthesis in amnion fibroblasts at parturition. We found that cortisol and 15(S)-HETE abundance increased parallelly in the amnion at parturition. Cortisol induced ALOX15/15B expression and 15(S)-HETE production paradoxically in amnion fibroblasts. Mechanism study revealed that this paradoxical induction was mediated by p300-mediated histone acetylation and interaction of glucocorticoid receptor with transcription factors CREB and STAT3. Conclusively, cortisol regenerated in the fetal membranes can paradoxically induce ALOX15/15B expression and 15(S)-HETE production in human amnion fibroblasts, which may further assist in the induction of PGE2 synthesis in the inflammatory responses of the fetal membranes for parturition."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Towards Countering Essentialism through Social Bias Reasoning""?","Essentialist beliefs (i.e., believing that members of the same group are fundamentally alike) play a central role in social stereotypes and can lead to harm when left unchallenged. In our work, we conduct exploratory studies into the task of countering essentialist beliefs (e.g., ``liberals are stupid''). Drawing on prior work from psychology and NLP, we construct five types of counterstatements and conduct human studies on the effectiveness of these different strategies. Our studies also investigate the role in choosing a counterstatement of the level of explicitness with which an essentialist belief is conveyed. We find that statements that broaden the scope of a stereotype (e.g., to other groups, as in ``conservatives can also be stupid'') are the most popular countering strategy. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and open questions for future work in this area (e.g., improving factuality, studying community-specific variation) and we emphasize the importance of work at the intersection of NLP and psychology."

However, we argue that its fixed 20ms resolution for hidden representations would not be optimal for various speech-processing tasks since their attributes (e.g., speaker characteristics and semantics) are based on different time scales. To address this limitation, we propose utilizing HuBERT representations at multiple resolutions for downstream tasks. We explore two approaches, namely the parallel and hierarchical approaches, for integrating HuBERT features with different resolutions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that HuBERT with multiple resolutions outperforms the original model. This highlights the potential of utilizing multiple resolutions in SSL models like HuBERT to capture diverse information from speech signals."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Cost analysis of three-dimensional radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer in Peruvian citizens""?","Background and objectives The standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer (CC) is chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) followed by high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRBT). The ideal scenario would be under novel intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiation techniques over three-dimensional (3D) radiation therapy. However, radiotherapy (RT) centres in low- and middle-income countries have limited equipment for teletherapy services like HDRBT. This is why the 3D modality is still in use. The objective of this study was to analyse costs in a comparison of 3D versus IMRT versus VMAT based on clinical staging. Materials and methods From 02/01/2022 to 05/01/2023 a prospective registry of the costs for oncological management was carried out for patients with locally advanced CC who received CTRT ± HDRBT. This included the administration of radiation with chemotherapy. The cost associated with patient and family transfers and hours in the hospital was also identified. These expenses were used to project the direct and indirect costs of 3D versus IMRT versus VMAT. Results The treatment regimens for stage IIIC2, including 3D and novel techniques, are those with the highest costs. The administration of 3D RT for IIIC2 and novel IMRT or VMAT techniques, is $3,881.69, $3,374.76, and $2,862.80, respectively. The indirect cost from stage IIB to IIIC1 in descending order is IMRT, 3D and VMAT, but in IIIC2 the novel technique regimens reduce by up to 33.99% compared to 3D. Conclusion In RT centres with an available supply of RT equipment, VMAT should be preferred over IMRT/3D since it reduces costs and toxicity. However, in RT centres where demand exceeds supply in the VMAT technique planning systems, the use of 3D teletherapy over IMRT/VMAT could continue to be used in patients with stage IIB to IIIC1."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""COBRA Frames: Contextual Reasoning about Effects and Harms of Offensive Statements""?","Warning: This paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. Understanding the harms and offensiveness of statements requires reasoning about the social and situational context in which statements are made. For example, the utterance""your English is very good""may implicitly signal an insult when uttered by a white man to a non-white colleague, but uttered by an ESL teacher to their student would be interpreted as a genuine compliment. Such contextual factors have been largely ignored by previous approaches to toxic language detection. We introduce COBRA frames, the first context-aware formalism for explaining the intents, reactions, and harms of offensive or biased statements grounded in their social and situational context. We create COBRACORPUS, a dataset of 33k potentially offensive statements paired with machine-generated contexts and free-text explanations of offensiveness, implied biases, speaker intents, and listener reactions. To study the contextual dynamics of offensiveness, we train models to generate COBRA explanations, with and without access to the context. We find that explanations by context-agnostic models are significantly worse than by context-aware ones, especially in situations where the context inverts the statement's offensiveness (29% accuracy drop). Our work highlights the importance and feasibility of contextualized NLP by modeling social factors."

Our model demonstrates a wide suite of multimodal capabilities: image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue. Ours is the first approach capable of conditioning on arbitrarily interleaved image and text inputs to generate coherent image (and text) outputs. To achieve strong performance on image generation, we propose an efficient mapping network to ground the LLM to an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model. This mapping network translates hidden representations of text into the embedding space of the visual models, enabling us to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs. Our approach outperforms baseline generation models on tasks with longer and more complex language. In addition to novel image generation, our model is also capable of image retrieval from a prespecified dataset, and decides whether to retrieve or generate at inference time. This is done with a learnt decision module which conditions on the hidden representations of the LLM. Our model exhibits a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models. It can process image-and-text inputs, and produce retrieved images, generated images, and generated text -- outperforming non-LLM based generation models across several text-to-image tasks that measure context dependence."

FLTs construct the optimal RPE mechanism implicitly by learning its spectral representation. As opposed to other architectures combining efficient low-rank linear attention with RPEs, FLTs remain practical in terms of their memory usage and do not require additional assumptions about the structure of the RPE-mask. FLTs allow also for applying certain structural inductive bias techniques to specify masking strategies, e.g. they provide a way to learn the so-called local RPEs introduced in this paper and providing accuracy gains as compared with several other linear Transformers for language modeling.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Prompting Audios Using Acoustic Properties For Emotion Representation""?","Emotions lie on a continuum, but current models treat emotions as a finite valued discrete variable. This representation does not capture the diversity in the expression of emotion. To better represent emotions we propose the use of natural language descriptions (or prompts). In this work, we address the challenge of automatically generating these prompts and training a model to better learn emotion representations from audio and prompt pairs. We use acoustic properties that are correlated to emotion like pitch, intensity, speech rate, and articulation rate to automatically generate prompts i.e. 'acoustic prompts'. We use a contrastive learning objective to map speech to their respective acoustic prompts. We evaluate our model on Emotion Audio Retrieval and Speech Emotion Recognition. Our results show that the acoustic prompts significantly improve the model's performance in EAR, in various Precision@K metrics. In SER, we observe a 3.8% relative accuracy improvement on the Ravdess dataset."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Multi-Channel Target Speaker Extraction with Refinement: The WavLab Submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge""?","This paper describes our submission to the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC2), which consists of target speech enhancement for hearing-aid (HA) devices in noisy-reverberant environments with multiple interferers such as music and competing speakers. Our approach builds upon the powerful iterative neural/beamforming enhancement (iNeuBe) framework introduced in our recent work, and this paper extends it for target speaker extraction. We therefore name the proposed approach as iNeuBe-X, where the X stands for extraction. To address the challenges encountered in the CEC2 setting, we introduce four major novelties: (1) we extend the state-of-the-art TF-GridNet model, originally designed for monaural speaker separation, for multi-channel, causal speech enhancement, and large improvements are observed by replacing the TCNDenseNet used in iNeuBe with this new architecture; (2) we leverage a recent dual window size approach with future-frame prediction to ensure that iNueBe-X satisfies the 5 ms constraint on algorithmic latency required by CEC2; (3) we introduce a novel speaker-conditioning branch for TF-GridNet to achieve target speaker extraction; (4) we propose a fine-tuning step, where we compute an additional loss with respect to the target speaker signal compensated with the listener audiogram. Without using external data, on the official development set our best model reaches a hearing-aid speech perception index (HASPI) score of 0.942 and a scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (SI-SDRi) of 18.8 dB. These results are promising given the fact that the CEC2 data is extremely challenging (e.g., on the development set the mixture SI-SDR is -12.3 dB). A demo of our submitted system is available at WAVLab CEC2 demo."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Queer In AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI""?","Queerness and queer people face an uncertain future in the face of ever more widely deployed and invasive artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies have caused numerous harms to queer people, including privacy violations, censoring and downranking queer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassment by making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer people. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness by classifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, the queer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, decentralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employs intersectional and community-led participatory design to build an inclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community’s programs over the years. We discuss different challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, and then assess the organization’s impact. Queer in AI provides important lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization, success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI, welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI’s work serves as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI, demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Structured Dialogue Discourse Parsing""?","Dialogue discourse parsing aims to uncover the internal structure of a multi-participant conversation by finding all the discourse links and corresponding relations. Previous work either treats this task as a series of independent multiple-choice problems, in which the link existence and relations are decoded separately, or the encoding is restricted to only local interaction, ignoring the holistic structural information. In contrast, we propose a principled method that improves upon previous work from two perspectives: encoding and decoding. From the encoding side, we perform structured encoding on the adjacency matrix followed by the matrix-tree learning algorithm, where all discourse links and relations in the dialogue are jointly optimized based on latent tree-level distribution. From the decoding side, we perform structured inference using the modified Chiu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm, which explicitly generates the labeled multi-root non-projective spanning tree that best captures the discourse structure. In addition, unlike in previous work, we do not rely on hand-crafted features; this improves the model’s robustness. Experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art, surpassing the previous model by 2.3 on STAC and 1.5 on Molweni (F1 scores)."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Improving Audio Captioning Models with Fine-grained Audio Features, Text Embedding Supervision, and LLM Mix-up Augmentation""?","Automated audio captioning (AAC) aims to generate informative descriptions for various sounds from nature and/or human activities. In recent years, AAC has quickly attracted research interest, with state-of-the-art systems now relying on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) backbone powered by strong models such as Transformers. Following the macro-trend of applied machine learning research, in this work, we strive to improve the performance of seq2seq AAC models by extensively leveraging pretrained models and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we utilize BEATs to extract fine-grained audio features. Then, we employ Instructor LLM to fetch text embeddings of captions, and infuse their language-modality knowledge into BEATs audio features via an auxiliary InfoNCE loss function. Moreover, we propose a novel data augmentation method that uses ChatGPT to produce caption mix-ups (i.e., grammatical and compact combinations of two captions) which, together with the corresponding audio mixtures, increase not only the amount but also the complexity and diversity of training data. During inference, we propose to employ nucleus sampling and a hybrid reranking algorithm, which has not been explored in AAC research. Combining our efforts, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art 32.6 SPIDEr-FL score on the Clotho evaluation split, and wins the 2023 DCASE AAC challenge."

Significance This third biennial intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) conference shows how optical contrast agents have been applied to develop clinically significant endpoints that improve precision cancer surgery. Aim National and international experts on IMI presented ongoing clinical trials in cancer surgery and preclinical work. Previously known dyes (with broader applications), new dyes, novel nonfluorescence-based imaging techniques, pediatric dyes, and normal tissue dyes were discussed. Approach Principal investigators presenting at the Perelman School of Medicine Abramson Cancer Center’s third clinical trials update on IMI were selected to discuss their clinical trials and endpoints. Results Dyes that are FDA-approved or currently under clinical investigation in phase 1, 2, and 3 trials were discussed. Sections on how to move benchwork research to the bedside were also included. There was also a dedicated section for pediatric dyes and nonfluorescence-based dyes that have been newly developed. Conclusions IMI is a valuable adjunct in precision cancer surgery and has broad applications in multiple subspecialties. It has been reliably used to alter the surgical course of patients and in clinical decision making. There remain gaps in the utilization of IMI in certain subspecialties and potential for developing newer and improved dyes and imaging techniques."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Plan, Eliminate, and Track - Language Models are Good Teachers for Embodied Agents""?","Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) capture procedural knowledge about the world. Recent work has leveraged LLM's ability to generate abstract plans to simplify challenging control tasks, either by action scoring, or action modeling (fine-tuning). However, the transformer architecture inherits several constraints that make it difficult for the LLM to directly serve as the agent: e.g. limited input lengths, fine-tuning inefficiency, bias from pre-training, and incompatibility with non-text environments. To maintain compatibility with a low-level trainable actor, we propose to instead use the knowledge in LLMs to simplify the control problem, rather than solving it. We propose the Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) framework. The Plan module translates a task description into a list of high-level sub-tasks. The Eliminate module masks out irrelevant objects and receptacles from the observation for the current sub-task. Finally, the Track module determines whether the agent has accomplished each sub-task. On the AlfWorld instruction following benchmark, the PET framework leads to a significant 15% improvement over SOTA for generalization to human goal specifications."

The readout electronics would saturate at energy deposits above several TeV in a single BGO bar of the DAMPE calorimeter. The total energy loss per event due to saturation can sometimes reach over a hundred TeV. We present a convolutional neural network model which can accurately recover the energy lost due to saturation and thus significantly increase the dynamic range of DAMPE. Another machine learning model combines the resolution of the hodoscopic BGO calorimeter and the high-resolution tracker of DAMPE to provide the best possible prediction of the direction of the incoming particle. This allows measuring charges at energies up to several hundred TeV. In this work, we present the application of these methods to carbon flux analysis."

However, this paradigm can lead to models that generate toxic, inaccurate, and unhelpful content, and automatic evaluation metrics often fail to identify these behaviors. As models become more capable, human feedback is an invaluable signal for evaluating and improving models. This survey aims to provide an overview of the recent research that has leveraged human feedback to improve natural language generation. First, we introduce an encompassing formalization of feedback, and identify and organize existing research into a taxonomy following this formalization. Next, we discuss how feedback can be described by its format and objective, and cover the two approaches proposed to use feedback (either for training or decoding): directly using the feedback or training feedback models. We also discuss existing datasets for human-feedback data collection, and concerns surrounding feedback collection. Finally, we provide an overview of the nascent field of AI feedback, which exploits large language models to make judgments based on a set of principles and minimize the need for human intervention."

We study various designs to pretrain T5 using an auxiliary model to construct more challenging token replacements for the main model to denoise. Key aspects under study include the decoding target, the location of the RTD head, and the masking pattern. Based on these studies, we develop a new model, METRO-T0, which is pretrained using the redesigned ELECTRA-Style pretraining strategies and then prompt-finetuned on a mixture of NLP tasks. METRO-T0 outperforms all similar-sized baselines on prompted NLP benchmarks, such as _T0 Eval_ and MMLU, and rivals the state-of-the-art T0-11B model with only **8%** of its parameters. Our analysis on model’s neural activation and parameter sensitivity reveals that the effectiveness of METRO-T0 stems from more balanced contribution of parameters and better utilization of their capacity.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Active Surveillance of Root Caries in Vivo with CP-OCT""?","The active surveillance of root caries lesions to monitor potential remineralization or decay progression is challenging for the clinician, due to unreliable diagnostic information. The conventional visual and tactile methods for assessing the lesion activity are not reliable, and the clinician is often unable to determine if the lesion is progressing or has been arrested. An important marker of an arrested lesion is a highly mineralized transparent surface zone (TSL) that forms when the mineral is deposited in the outer layer of the lesion. The purpose of this study was to determine if cross-polarization optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT) could be used to detect changes in the lesion severity and activity during active monitoring. In total, 18 subjects with 22 suspected active root caries lesions were evaluated using CP-OCT at the baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. All subjects were instructed to use a high fluoride dentifrice at the baseline. The results showed that CP-OCT was able to discriminate the active from the arrested lesions by identifying the presence of a TSL on arrested lesions. The results also indicated that the mean TSL thickness increased significantly (p < 0.05) for the nine lesion areas. In addition, CP-OCT was able to show the progression of demineralization, erosion, and changes in gingival contours in scanned areas. CP-OCT was valuable for monitoring the activity and severity of root caries lesions in vivo. CP-OCT can be used to assess the activity of root caries lesions at a single time point by detecting the presence of a TSL at the lesion surface indicative of the lesion arrest."

We present the semantic notion of agentivity as a case study for probing such interactions. We created a novel evaluation dataset by utilitizing the unique linguistic properties of a subset of optionally transitive English verbs. This dataset was used to prompt varying sizes of three model classes to see if they are sensitive to agentivity at the lexical level, and if they can appropriately employ these word-level priors given a specific syntactic context. Overall, GPT-3 text-davinci-003 performs extremely well across all experiments, outperforming all other models tested by far. In fact, the results are even better correlated with human judgements than both syntactic and semantic corpus statistics. This suggests that LMs may potentially serve as more useful tools for linguistic annotation, theory testing, and discovery than select corpora for certain tasks."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Visible and Infrared Image Fusion of Forest Fire Scenes Based on Generative Adversarial Networks with Multi-Classification and Multi-Level Constraints""?","Aimed at addressing deficiencies in existing image fusion methods, this paper proposed a multi-level and multi-classification generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method (MMGAN) for fusing visible and infrared images of forest fire scenes (the surroundings of firefighters), which solves the problem that GANs tend to ignore visible contrast ratio information and detailed infrared texture information. The study was based on real-time visible and infrared image data acquired by visible and infrared binocular cameras on forest firefighters’ helmets. We improved the GAN by, on the one hand, splitting the input channels of the generator into gradient and contrast ratio paths, increasing the depth of convolutional layers, and improving the extraction capability of shallow networks. On the other hand, we designed a discriminator using a multi-classification constraint structure and trained it against the generator in a continuous and adversarial manner to supervise the generator, generating better-quality fused images. Our results indicated that compared to mainstream infrared and visible image fusion methods, including anisotropic diffusion fusion (ADF), guided filtering fusion (GFF), convolutional neural networks (CNN), FusionGAN, and dual-discriminator conditional GAN (DDcGAN), the MMGAN model was overall optimal and had the best visual effect when applied to image fusions of forest fire surroundings. Five of the six objective metrics were optimal, and one ranked second-to-optimal. The image fusion speed was more than five times faster than that of the other methods. The MMGAN model significantly improved the quality of fused images of forest fire scenes, preserved the contrast ratio information of visible images and the detailed texture information of infrared images of forest fire scenes, and could accurately reflect information on forest fire scene surroundings."

A total of thirty avian frugivore species were recorded feeding on twenty-two focal tree species using phyto-centric approach. Characteristic traits of fruits like fruit diameter, colour and type and their interacting avian species were studied based on their fruit handling behaviour. The highest number of avian frugivore species were observed on native Ficus tree species in urban Delhi ecosystem, thereby providing evident proof of being an important food resource for avian disperser communities. The study suggests to introduce more native fig tree species in the city plantations to enhance and sustain the avian diversity in the novel fragmented urban ecosystems."

Methods: In the multi-centric, prospective, randomised, double-blind clinical trial, either vitamin D alone (group I) or myoinositol and D-chiro inositol plus Vitamin D (group II) were administered to pregnant women from 12 weeks of gestation. The administration was continued until delivery to primigravids who were normoglycemic at 12 weeks of gestation and consented. From October 2018 to December 2019. A total of 1250 women were enrolled, and randomly allocated to either of the groups: 630 women in Group I and 620 in Group II. The allocation was blinded. The primary outcome was the rate of GDM as assessed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) recommended by diabetes in pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the Government of India, at first antenatal visit followed by at weeks 24 to 28 in both the groups. Results: The rate of GDM was found more in group I as compared to group II treated with myoinositol and D-chiro Inositol plus vitamin D, but the difference was not statistically significant (5.08% in group I and 3.22% in group II). Conclusions: In conclusion, an improved trend has been noticed in the reduction of the rate of GDM with myoinositol and D-chiro inositol plus vitamin D as compared to vitamin D alone. Myoinositol and D-chiro inositol plus vitamin D supplementation may be a good option for pregnant women to prevent the GDM occurrence especially in women having positive risk factors for GDM."

When electron-hole pairs are produced by the exposure to high-energy radiation, the activator ion in the lattice preferentially captures one of the charge carriers. The subsequent capture of the carrier of opposite charge yields the activator ion luminescence. The carrier of the opposite charge can also be diverted to defects in the lattice. The trapping by defects reduces the brightness of phosphors and is responsible for the unwanted afterglow in scintillators. The strategy that is adopted to suppress the trapping by defects is to deliberately introduce an impurity ion that can compete successfully with the defects for the charge carrier. Since the impurity ion traps charge of the opposite sign to the activator ion, we label them as “anti-activators.” While the use of anti-activators gained importance in the field of scintillators in the 1990’s, results on their use for improving brightness of lamp and cathode-ray phosphors were available in the literature of the 1960’s and 1970’s."

We provide a differentiable estimator for four categories of low-level acoustic descriptors involving: frequency-related parameters, energy or amplitude-related parameters, spectral balance parameters, and temporal features. Un-like prior work that looks at aggregated acoustic parameters or a few categories of acoustic parameters, our temporal acoustic parameter (TAP) loss enables auxiliary optimization and improvement of many fine-grained speech characteristics in enhancement workflows. We show that adding TAPLoss as an auxiliary objective in speech enhancement produces speech with improved perceptual quality and intelligibility.

We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered. Our analysis reveals that a language’s resource level is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT’s relative ability to translate it, and suggests that ChatGPT is especially disadvantaged for LRLs and African languages."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Integrative Multi-omic Profiling of Two Human Decedents Receiving Pig Heart Xenografts Reveals Strong Perturbations in Early Immune-Cell and Cellular Metabolism Responses""?","Background Recent advances in xenotransplantation in living and decedent humans using pig xenografts have laid promising groundwork towards future emergency use and first in human trials. Major obstacles remain though, including a lack of knowledge of the genetic incompatibilities between pig donors and human recipients which may led to harmful immune responses against the xenograft or dysregulation of normal physiology. In 2022 two pig heart xenografts were transplanted into two brain-dead human decedents with a minimized immunosuppression regime, primarily to evaluate onset of hyper-acute antibody mediated rejection and sustained xenograft function over 3 days. Methods We performed multi-omic profiling to assess the dynamic interactions between the pig and human genomes in the first two pig heart-xenografts transplants into human decedents. To assess global and specific biological changes that may correlate with immune-related outcomes and xenograft function, we generated transcriptomic, lipidomic, proteomic and metabolomics datasets, across blood and tissue samples collected every 6 hours over the 3-day procedures. Results Single-cell datasets in the 3-day pig xenograft-decedent models show dynamic immune activation processes. We observe specific scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq and geospatial transcriptomic changes of early immune-activation leading to pronounced downstream T-cell activity and hallmarks of early antibody mediated rejection (AbMR) and/or ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in the first xenograft recipient. Using longitudinal multiomic integrative analyses from blood in addition to antigen presentation pathway enrichment, we also observe in the first xeno-heart recipient significant cellular metabolism and liver damage pathway changes that correlate with profound physiological dysfunction whereas, these signals are not present in the other xenograft recipient. Conclusions Single-cell and multiomics approaches reveal fundamental insights into early molecular immune responses indicative of IRI and/or early AbMR in the first human decedent, which was not evident in the conventional histological evaluations."

Different from prior work, our attacks can affect the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to the LLM while being stealthy and generalizable to multiple input prompts. We construct these attacks using gradient-based adversarial training and characterize performance along multiple dimensions. We find that our adversarial images can manipulate the LLM to invoke tools following real-world syntax almost always (~98%) while maintaining high similarity to clean images (~0.9 SSIM). Furthermore, using human scoring and automated metrics, we find that the attacks do not noticeably affect the conversation (and its semantics) between the user and the LLM."

This study aimed to investigate the utility of clinical and MR imaging features for differentiating between IDEM spinal and myxopapillary ependymomas. Materials and Methods We compared tumor size, longitudinal/axial location, enhancement degree/pattern, tumor margin, signal intensity (SI) of the tumor on T2-weighted images and T1-weighted image (T1WI), increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SI caudal to the tumor on T1WI, and CSF dissemination of pathologically confirmed 12 IDEM spinal and 10 myxopapillary ependymomas. Furthermore, classification and regression tree (CART) was performed to identify the clinical and MR features for differentiating between IDEM spinal and myxopapillary ependymomas. Results Patients with IDEM spinal ependymomas were older than those with myxopapillary ependymomas (48 years vs. 29.5 years, p < 0.05). A high SI of the tumor on T1W1 was more frequently observed in IDEM spinal ependymomas than in myxopapillary ependymomas (p = 0.02). Conversely, myxopapillary ependymomas show CSF dissemination. Increased CSF SI caudal to the tumor on T1WI was observed more frequently in myxopapillary ependymomas than in IDEM spinal ependymomas (p < 0.05). Dissemination to the CSF space and increased CSF SI caudal to the tumor on T1WI were the most important variables in CART analysis.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Computational Language Acquisition with Theory of Mind""?","Unlike current state-of-the-art language models, young children actively acquire language through interactions with their surrounding environment and caretakers. One mechanism that has been argued to be critical to language learning is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack&Woodruff (1978). Drawing inspiration from the modern operationalized versions of ToM implemented in Rabinowitz et al. (2018) and Zhu et al. (2021), we build language-learning agents equipped with ToM, and measure its effects on the learning process. We model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We experiment with varying task difficulty, hypothesizing that models will acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. We find that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in our image referential game setting. We also find some evidence that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation. This suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition."

We utilize the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model as the backbone for our experiments. We compared our approach to the more direct approach of utilizing hidden states for classification. Evaluation shows the exceptional performance of our method in the text classification task, highlighting its simplicity and efficiency. Furthermore, interpretability studies on the features extracted by our model reveal its ability to differentiate distinctive writing styles among various LLMs even in the absence of an explicit classifier. We also collected a dataset named OpenLLMText, containing approximately 340k text samples from human and LLMs, including GPT3.5, PaLM, LLaMA, and GPT2."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""SALMON: Self-Alignment with Principle-Following Reward Models""?","Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on response demonstrations combined with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) constitutes a powerful paradigm for aligning LLM-based AI agents. However, a significant limitation of such an approach is its dependency on high-quality human annotations, making its application to intricate tasks challenging due to difficulties in obtaining consistent response demonstrations and in-distribution response preferences. This paper presents a novel approach, namely SALMON (Self-ALignMent with principle-fOllowiNg reward models), to align base language models with minimal human supervision, using only a small set of human-defined principles, yet achieving superior performance. Central to our approach is a principle-following reward model. Trained on synthetic preference data, this model can generate reward scores based on arbitrary human-defined principles. By merely adjusting these principles during the RL training phase, we gain full control over the preferences with the reward model, subsequently influencing the behavior of the RL-trained policies, and eliminating the reliance on the collection of online human preferences. Applying our method to the LLaMA-2-70b base language model, we developed an AI assistant named Dromedary-2. With only 6 exemplars for in-context learning and 31 human-defined principles, Dromedary-2 significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including LLaMA-2-Chat-70b, on various benchmark datasets. We have open-sourced the code and model weights to encourage further research into aligning LLM-based AI agents with enhanced supervision efficiency, improved controllability, and scalable oversight."

Automated tools can help app developers catch basic issues, but can be laborious or require writing dedicated tests. We propose a system, motivated by a collaborative process with accessibility stakeholders at a large technology company, to generate whole app accessibility reports by combining varied data collection methods (e.g., app crawling, manual recording) with an existing accessibility scanner. Many such scanners are based on single-screen scanning, and a key problem in whole app accessibility reporting is to effectively de-duplicate and summarize issues collected across an app. To this end, we developed a screen grouping model with 96.9% accuracy (88.8% F1-score) and UI element matching heuristics with 97% accuracy (98.2% F1-score). We combine these technologies in a system to report and summarize unique issues across an app, and enable a unique pixel-based ignore feature to help engineers and testers better manage reported issues across their app's lifetime. We conducted a qualitative evaluation with 18 accessibility-focused engineers and testers which showed this system can enhance their existing accessibility testing toolkit and address key limitations in current accessibility scanning tools."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""InPars-Light: Cost-Effective Unsupervised Training of Efficient Rankers""?","We carried out a reproducibility study of InPars, which is a method for unsupervised training of neural rankers (Bonifacio et al., 2022). As a by-product, we developed InPars-light, which is a simple-yet-effective modification of InPars. Unlike InPars, InPars-light uses 7x-100x smaller ranking models and only a freely available language model BLOOM, which -- as we found out -- produced more accurate rankers compared to a proprietary GPT-3 model. On all five English retrieval collections (used in the original InPars study) we obtained substantial (7%-30%) and statistically significant improvements over BM25 (in nDCG and MRR) using only a 30M parameter six-layer MiniLM-30M ranker and a single three-shot prompt. In contrast, in the InPars study only a 100x larger monoT5-3B model consistently outperformed BM25, whereas their smaller monoT5-220M model (which is still 7x larger than our MiniLM ranker) outperformed BM25 only on MS MARCO and TREC DL 2020. In the same three-shot prompting scenario, our 435M parameter DeBERTA v3 ranker was at par with the 7x larger monoT5-3B (average gain over BM25 of 1.3 vs 1.32): In fact, on three out of five datasets, DeBERTA slightly outperformed monoT5-3B. Finally, these good results were achieved by re-ranking only 100 candidate documents compared to 1000 used by Bonifacio et al. (2022). We believe that InPars-light is the first truly cost-effective prompt-based unsupervised recipe to train and deploy neural ranking models that outperform BM25.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Training Audio Captioning Models without Audio""?","Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) is the task of generating natural language descriptions given an audio stream. A typical AAC system requires manually curated training data of audio segments and corresponding text caption annotations. The creation of these audio-caption pairs is costly, resulting in general data scarcity for the task. In this work, we address this major limitation and propose an approach to train AAC systems using only text. Our approach leverages the multimodal space of contrastively trained audio-text models, such as CLAP. During training, a decoder generates captions conditioned on the pretrained CLAP text encoder. During inference, the text encoder is replaced with the pretrained CLAP audio encoder. To bridge the modality gap between text and audio embeddings, we propose the use of noise injection or a learnable adapter, during training. We find that the proposed text-only framework performs competitively with state-of-the-art models trained with paired audio, showing that efficient text-to-audio transfer is possible. Finally, we showcase both stylized audio captioning and caption enrichment while training without audio or human-created text captions."

Herein, the highly efficient RuO2/Co3O4 electrocatalyst with a uniform nanoflower structure is prepared by hydrothermal growth combined with interface engineering. Benefiting from the unique nanostructure, the migration of electrons and intermediates is optimized by the sufficient exposure of abundant micropores and defects. Moreover, the formation of strong electronic interaction at the RuO2/Co3O4 heterointerfaces boosts the electrochemical active surface area and accelerates the reaction kinetics, which effectively improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst. Based on enhanced intrinsic activity and electron transfer, the as‐synthesized RuO2/Co3O4 displays impressive hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activity, which respectively require low overpotentials of 240 and 100 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 m H2SO4. As a bifunctional electrode, RuO2/Co3O4 exhibits a low operating voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm−2 for overall electrochemical water splitting.

The pole-to-pole transient fault process was divided into three stages, the time-domain expression of the DC current during the diode freewheel stage was used to locate the fault point, and a criterion for judging whether the fault evolves to the diode freewheel stage was proposed. Taking into account the enhancing effect of the opposite system to the fault current, theDC side pole-to-ground fault networkwas equated to a fourth-order circuit model, the relationship of fault distance with the characteristic roots of fault current differential equationwas derived, and the Prony algorithmwas utilized for datafitting to extract characteristic roots to realize fault location. A two-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system was modelled in PSCAD/EMTDC. The simulation result verifies that the proposed principle can accurately locate the fault point on the VSC-HVDC transmission lines."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Numerical Analysis on the Influence of Joint Density on the Stability of Complex Jointed Roadway Surrounding Rock""?","The random distribution of a complex joint network within a coal–rock mass has a significant weakening effect on its bearing capacity, making the surrounding rock of the roadway highly susceptible to instability and failure under the influence of in situ stress and mining-induced stress. This poses challenges in controlling the surrounding rock and seriously affects the normal production of mines. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct stability analysis on complex jointed roadway surrounding rock. Therefore, taking the transport roadway of Panel 11030 in the Zhaogu No. 2 Coal Mine as a case study, the microscopic contact parameters of particles and joint surfaces in each rock layer were calibrated through uniaxial compression and shear simulation tests using the particle flow simulation software PFC2D 5.0. Based on the calibrated microscopic contact parameters, a multilayered roadway surrounding rock model containing complex joints was established, and the joint density was quantified to analyze its effects on the displacement field, stress field, force chain field, and energy field of the roadway surrounding rock. The research findings indicate that as the distance to the sidewall decreases, the impact of joint density on the deformation of the surrounding rock of the roadway increases. The displacement of the roadway roof, floor, and sidewalls is affected differently by the joint density, predominantly contingent upon the properties of the rock mass. During the process of stress redistribution in the surrounding rock, the vertical stress of the roof and floor is released more intensively compared to the horizontal stress, while the horizontal stress of the sidewalls is released more intensively compared to the vertical stress. The increase in joint density leads to an increasing release rate of the surrounding rock stress, causing the load-bearing rock mass to transfer towards the deeper part. As the joint density increases, the force chain network gradually transitions from dense to sparse, resulting in a decrease in strong force chains and a decline in the bearing capacity of the surrounding rock, accompanied by an expansion in the range of force chain failure and deformation. With the continuous increase in joint density, the values of maximum released kinetic energy and residual released kinetic energy become larger. Once the joint density reaches a certain threshold, the kinetic energy stability zone consistently maintains a high energy level, indicating extreme instability in the roadway and sustained deformation. The results provide a valuable insight for analyzing the failure mechanism of complex jointed roadway surrounding rock and implementing corresponding support measures."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Semi-Autoregressive Streaming ASR With Label Context""?","Non-autoregressive (NAR) modeling has gained significant interest in speech processing since these models achieve dramatically lower inference time than autoregressive (AR) models while also achieving good transcription accuracy. Since NAR automatic speech recognition (ASR) models must wait for the completion of the entire utterance before processing, some works explore streaming NAR models based on blockwise attention for low-latency applications. However, streaming NAR models significantly lag in accuracy compared to streaming AR and non-streaming NAR models. To address this, we propose a streaming""semi-autoregressive""ASR model that incorporates the labels emitted in previous blocks as additional context using a Language Model (LM) subnetwork. We also introduce a novel greedy decoding algorithm that addresses insertion and deletion errors near block boundaries while not significantly increasing the inference time. Experiments show that our method outperforms the existing streaming NAR model by 19% relative on Tedlium2, 16%/8% on Librispeech-100 clean/other test sets, and 19%/8% on the Switchboard(SWB)/Callhome(CH) test sets. It also reduced the accuracy gap with streaming AR and non-streaming NAR models while achieving 2.5x lower latency.

In the context of vision, we hypothesize that an important contributor to the robustness of human visual perception is constant exposure to low-fidelity visual stimuli in our peripheral vision. To investigate this hypothesis, we develop \RBlur, an image transform that simulates the loss in fidelity of peripheral vision by blurring the image and reducing its color saturation based on the distance from a given fixation point. We show that compared to DNNs trained on the original images, DNNs trained on images transformed by \RBlur are substantially more robust to adversarial attacks, as well as other, non-adversarial, corruptions, achieving up to 25\% higher accuracy on perturbed data."

Does parents’ depression strongly affect the behavior of their children as well? To investigate this question, we compared dyadic interactions between 73 depressed and 75 non-depressed mothers and their adolescent child. Families were of low income and 84% were white. Child behavior was measured from audio-video recordings using manual annotation of verbal and nonverbal behavior by expert coders and by multimodal computational measures of facial expression, face and head dynamics, prosody, speech behavior, and linguistics. For both sets of measures, we used Support Vector Machines. For computational measures, we investigated the relative contribution of single versus multiple modalities using a novel approach to SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Computational measures outperformed manual ratings by human experts. Among individual computational measures, prosody was the most informative. SHAP reduction resulted in a four-fold decrease in the number of features and highest performance (77% accuracy; positive and negative agreements at 75% and 76%, respectively). These findings suggest that maternal depression strongly impacts the behavior of adolescent children; differences are most revealed in prosody; multimodal features together with SHAP reduction are most powerful."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Structure-Aware Language Model Pretraining Improves Dense Retrieval on Structured Data""?","This paper presents Structure Aware Dense Retrieval (SANTA) model, which encodes user queries and structured data in one universal embedding space for retrieving structured data. SANTA proposes two pretraining methods to make language models structure-aware and learn effective representations for structured data: 1) Structured Data Alignment, which utilizes the natural alignment relations between structured data and unstructured data for structure-aware pretraining. It contrastively trains language models to represent multi-modal text data and teaches models to distinguish matched structured data for unstructured texts. 2) Masked Entity Prediction, which designs an entity-oriented mask strategy and asks language models to fill in the masked entities. Our experiments show that SANTA achieves state-of-the-art on code search and product search and conducts convincing results in the zero-shot setting. SANTA learns tailored representations for multi-modal text data by aligning structured and unstructured data pairs and capturing structural semantics by masking and predicting entities in the structured data.

Yet, little research has been conducted to determine how well today’s mobile app privacy labels address people’s actual privacy concerns or questions. We analyze a crowd-sourced corpus of privacy questions collected from mobile app users to determine to what extent these mobile app labels actually address users’ privacy concerns and questions. While there are differences between iOS labels and Google Play labels, our results indicate that an important percentage of people’s privacy questions are not answered or only partially addressed in today’s labels. Findings from this work not only shed light on the additional fields that would need to be included in mobile app privacy labels but can also help inform refinements to existing labels to better address users’ typical privacy questions"

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""3D Open-vocabulary Segmentation with Foundation Models""?","Open-vocabulary segmentation of 3D scenes is a fundamental function of human perception and thus a crucial objective in computer vision research. However, this task is heavily impeded by the lack of large-scale and diverse 3D open-vocabulary segmentation datasets for training robust and generalizable models. Distilling knowledge from pre-trained 2D open-vocabulary segmentation models helps but it compromises the open-vocabulary feature significantly as the 2D models are mostly finetuned with close-vocabulary datasets. We tackle the challenges in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation by exploiting the open-vocabulary multimodal knowledge and object reasoning capability of pre-trained foundation models CLIP and DINO, without necessitating any fine-tuning. Specifically, we distill open-vocabulary visual and textual knowledge from CLIP into a neural radiance field (NeRF) which effectively lifts 2D features into view-consistent 3D segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce the Relevancy-Distribution Alignment loss and Feature-Distribution Alignment loss to respectively mitigate the ambiguities of CLIP features and distill precise object boundaries from DINO features, eliminating the need for segmentation annotations during training. Extensive experiments show that our method even outperforms fully supervised models trained with segmentation annotations, suggesting that 3D open-vocabulary segmentation can be effectively learned from 2D images and text-image pairs."

In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of reconstructing the 3D facial shape from voice from a geometry perspective without any semantic information. We propose a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry, we can eliminate the influence of unpredictable AMs and make the face geometry tractable. Our approach is evaluated on our proposed dataset with ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and we find significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium. Our work offers a new perspective on voice-face correlation and can serve as a good empirical study for anthropometry science."

Evaluation shows the exceptional performance of our method in the text classification task, highlighting its simplicity and efficiency. Furthermore, interpretability studies on the features extracted by our model reveal its ability to differentiate distinctive writing styles among various LLMs even in the absence of an explicit classifier.

Henry Flackett of Stanshope in Alstonefield, Staffordshire, was killed by three assailants known to him in 1515, provoked by a contested heap of manure. A combination of sources provides an unusually vivid and detailed picture of the crime, in which gentry honour played a part, provoking an attempt to enforce the law through the conventional channels of inquest, common law, and equity courts. The event is set in the context of the society, economy and landscape of the Staffordshire Moorlands in a period of agrarian change."

Though language technologies are growing more prevalent in these contexts, empowerment has seldom been studied in NLP, and moreover, it is inherently challenging to operationalize because of its implicit nature. This work builds from linguistic and social psychology literature to explore what characterizes empowering language. We then crowdsource a novel dataset of Reddit posts labeled for empowerment, reasons why these posts are empowering to readers, and the social relationships between posters and readers. Our preliminary analyses show that this dataset, which we call TalkUp, can be used to train language models that capture empowering and disempowering language. More broadly, TalkUp provides an avenue to explore implication, presuppositions, and how social context influences the meaning of language."

In the wake of this transition, a number of all-neural ASR architectures have been introduced. These so-called end-to-end (E2E) models provide highly integrated, completely neural ASR models, which rely strongly on general machine learning knowledge, learn more consistently from data, with lower dependence on ASR domain-specific experience. The success and enthusiastic adoption of deep learning, accompanied by more generic model architectures has led to E2E models now becoming the prominent ASR approach. The goal of this survey is to provide a taxonomy of E2E ASR models and corresponding improvements, and to discuss their properties and their relationship to classical hidden Markov model (HMM) based ASR architectures. All relevant aspects of E2E ASR are covered in this work: modeling, training, decoding, and external language model integration, discussions of performance and deployment opportunities, as well as an outlook into potential future developments."

To bridge this research gap, this study, by deeply interviewing 13 entrepreneurs in environmental protection enterprises, clarified the concept of corporate responsible innovation and its four-dimensional framework (inclusion, anticipation, reflexivity, responsiveness), and then proposed the MPN-MSE driving factor model of corporate responsible innovation from the internal and external perspectives. The external factors include market pressure (M), policy pressure (P), and normative pressure (N), while the internal factors include responsible innovation motivation (M), responsible innovation system (S), and responsible innovation elements (E).

We investigated the formation of antitaxial, bed-parallel fibrous calcite veins hosted in organic-rich shales of the Eocene Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China. Our results from detailed, in situ geochemical traverses show that while some symmetric veins exhibit broadly synchronous and steady-state opening, other asymmetric veins consist of two geochemically distinct generations of calcite to either side of the median zone, suggesting asymmetric and asynchronous growth in two discrete episodes during hydrocarbon expulsion. Thus, we argue that each asymmetric vein recording two stages of opening implies that hydrocarbons were expelled from shales episodically."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""DementiaBank: Theoretical Rationale, Protocol, and Illustrative Analyses""?","Purpose: Dementia from Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized primarily by a significant decline in memory abilities; however, language abilities are also commonly affected and may precede the decline of other cognitive abilities. To study the progression of language, there is a need for open-access databases that can be used to build algorithms to produce translational models sensitive enough to detect early declines in language abilities. DementiaBank is an open-access repository of transcribed video/audio data from communicative interactions from people with dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls. The aims of this tutorial are to (a) describe the newly established standardized DementiaBank discourse protocol, (b) describe the Delaware corpus data, and (c) provide examples of automated linguistic analyses that can be conducted with the Delaware corpus data and describe additional DementiaBank resources. Method: The DementiaBank discourse protocol elicits four types of discourse: picture description, story narrative, procedural, and personal narrative. The Delaware corpus currently includes data from 20 neurotypical adults and 33 adults with MCI from possible AD who completed the DementiaBank discourse protocol and a cognitive–linguistic battery. Language samples were video- and audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and uploaded to DementiaBank. The protocol materials and transcription programs can be accessed for free via the DementiaBank website. Results: Illustrative analyses show the potential of the Delaware corpus data to help understand discourse metrics at the individual and group levels. In addition, they highlight analyses that could be used across TalkBank's other clinical banks (e.g., AphasiaBank). Information is also included on manual and automatic speech recognition transcription methods. Conclusions: DementiaBank is a shared online database that can facilitate research efforts to address the gaps in knowledge about language changes associated with MCI and dementia from AD. Identifying early language markers could lead to improved assessment and treatment approaches for adults at risk for dementia."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Training Audio Captioning Models without Audio""?","Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) is the task of generating natural language descriptions given an audio stream. A typical AAC system requires manually curated training data of audio segments and corresponding text caption annotations. The creation of these audio-caption pairs is costly, resulting in general data scarcity for the task. In this work, we address this major limitation and propose an approach to train AAC systems using only text. Our approach leverages the multimodal space of contrastively trained audio-text models, such as CLAP. During training, a decoder generates captions conditioned on the pretrained CLAP text encoder. During inference, the text encoder is replaced with the pretrained CLAP audio encoder. To bridge the modality gap between text and audio embeddings, we propose the use of noise injection or a learnable adapter, during training. We find that the proposed text-only framework performs competitively with state-of-the-art models trained with paired audio, showing that efficient text-to-audio transfer is possible. Finally, we showcase both stylized audio captioning and caption enrichment while training without audio or human-created text captions."

There are usually five types of OLP: reticular/papular, plaque-like, atrophic/erythematous, erosive/ulcerative, and bullous. Furthermore, the chance of causing oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is 1.4%. Although the etiology of OLP is still unknown, accumulating evidence supports that immune dysregulation may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of OLP, especially the massive production of various inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators. In this review, we focus on the relationship between OLP and its immune microenvironment. We summarize current developments in the immunology of OLP, summarizing functional cell types and crucial cytokines in the OLP immune microenvironment and the underlying mechanisms of key signaling pathways in the OLP immune microenvironment.

We demonstrate that the combination of one generation and one segmentation stage effectively functions as a mask denoiser. Through alternation between the generation and segmentation stages, the partial object mask is progressively refined, providing precise shape guidance and yielding superior object completion results.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Using Implicit Feedback to Improve Question Generation""?","Question Generation (QG) is a task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims at automatically generating questions from text. Many applications can benefit from automatically generated questions, but often it is necessary to curate those questions, either by selecting or editing them. This task is informative on its own, but it is typically done post-generation, and, thus, the effort is wasted. In addition, most existing systems cannot incorporate this feedback back into them easily. In this work, we present a system, GEN, that learns from such (implicit) feedback. Following a pattern-based approach, it takes as input a small set of sentence/question pairs and creates patterns which are then applied to new unseen sentences. Each generated question, after being corrected by the user, is used as a new seed in the next iteration, so more patterns are created each time. We also take advantage of the corrections made by the user to score the patterns and therefore rank the generated questions.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""PGAM1 Inhibition Promotes HCC Ferroptosis and Synergizes with Anti‐PD‐1 Immunotherapy""?","The combination of immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapy exhibits promising therapeutic efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Here, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is identified as a novel immunometabolic target by using a bioinformatic algorithm based on multiple HCC datasets. PGAM1 is highly expressed in HCC and associated with a poor prognosis and a poor response to immunotherapy. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that targeting PGAM1 inhibited HCC cell growth and promoted the infiltration of CD8+ T‐cells due to decreased enzymatic activity. Mechanistically, inhibition of PGAM1 promotes HCC cell ferroptosis by downregulating Lipocalin (LCN2) by inducing energy stress and ROS‐dependent AKT inhibition, which can also downregulate Programmed death 1‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1). Moreover, an allosteric PGAM1 inhibitor (KH3) exhibits good antitumor effects in patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) models and enhanced the efficacy of anti‐PD‐1 immunotherapy in subcutaneous and orthotopic HCC models. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that PGAM1 inhibition exerts an antitumor effect by promoting ferroptosis and CD8+ T‐cell infiltration and can synergize with anti‐PD‐1 immunotherapy in HCC. Targeting PGAM1 can be a promising new strategy of “killing two birds with one stone” for HCC treatment."

It has a weak γ-ray emission in the very early phase and is followed by a bright spiky γ-ray emission pulse. The radiation spectrum of the very early emission is best fitted by a power-law function with index ∼−1.7. However, the bright spiky γ-ray pulse, especially the time around the peak, exhibits a distinct two-component radiation spectrum, i.e., Band function combined with a blackbody radiation spectrum. We infer the photospheric properties and reveal a medium magnetization at a photospheric position by adopting the initial size of the outflow as r 0 = 109 cm. It implies that the Band component in this pulse may be formed during the dissipation of the magnetic field. The power-law radiation spectra found in the very early prompt emission may imply the external-shock origination of this phase. Then, we perform the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method fitting on the light curves of this burst, where the jet corresponding to the γ-ray pulse at around 20 s is used to refresh the external shock. It is shown that the light curves of the very early phase and X-ray afterglow after 40 s, involving the X-ray bump at around 100 s, can be well modeled in the external-shock scenario. For the obtained initial outflow, we estimate the minimum magnetization factor of the jet based on the fact that the photospheric emission of this jet is missed in the very early phase."

We further propose to jointly train an auxiliary task, target prediction, and to incorporate manually constructed incorrect samples with unlikelihood training to improve the representations for both target and label texts.

With limited training data, the GAN discriminator often suffers from severe overfitting which directly leads to degraded generation especially in generation diversity. Inspired by the recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD), we propose KD-DLGAN, a knowledge-distillation based generation framework that introduces pre-trained vision-language models for training effective data-limited generation models. KD-DLGAN consists of two innovative designs. The first is aggregated generative KD that mitigates the discriminator overfitting by challenging the discriminator with harder learning tasks and distilling more generalizable knowledge from the pre-trained models. The second is correlated generative KD that improves the generation diversity by distilling and preserving the diverse image-text correlation within the pre-trained models. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks show that KD-DLGAN achieves superior image generation with limited training data. In addition, KD-DLGAN complements the state-of-the-art with consistent and substantial performance gains. Note that codes will be released."

It generalizes well to various speech recognition and translation benchmarks even in a zero-shot setup. However, the full pipeline for developing such models (from data collection to training) is not publicly accessible, which makes it difficult for researchers to further improve its performance and address training-related issues such as efficiency, robustness, fairness, and bias. This work presents an Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM), which reproduces Whisperstyle training using an open-source toolkit and publicly available data. OWSM even supports more translation directions and can be more efficient to train.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""MatFormer: Nested Transformer for Elastic Inference""?","Transformer models are deployed in a wide range of settings, from multi-accelerator clusters to standalone mobile phones. The diverse inference constraints in these scenarios necessitate practitioners to train foundation models such as PaLM 2, Llama,&ViTs as a series of models of varying sizes. Due to significant training costs, only a select few model sizes are trained and supported, limiting more fine-grained control over relevant tradeoffs, including latency, cost, and accuracy. This work introduces MatFormer, a nested Transformer architecture designed to offer elasticity in a variety of deployment constraints. Each Feed Forward Network (FFN) block of a MatFormer model is jointly optimized with a few nested smaller FFN blocks. This training procedure allows for the Mix'n'Match of model granularities across layers -- i.e., a trained universal MatFormer model enables extraction of hundreds of accurate smaller models, which were never explicitly optimized. We empirically demonstrate MatFormer's effectiveness across different model classes (decoders&encoders), modalities (language&vision), and scales (up to 2.6B parameters). We find that a 2.6B decoder-only MatFormer language model (MatLM) allows us to extract smaller models spanning from 1.5B to 2.6B, each exhibiting comparable validation loss and one-shot downstream evaluations to their independently trained counterparts. Furthermore, we observe that smaller encoders extracted from a universal MatFormer-based ViT (MatViT) encoder preserve the metric-space structure for adaptive large-scale retrieval. Finally, we showcase that speculative decoding with the accurate and consistent submodels extracted from MatFormer can further reduce inference latency."

In this Letter, we report the measurements of diffuse γ rays from the Galactic plane between 10 TeV and 1 PeV energies, with the square kilometer array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Diffuse emissions from the inner (15°<l<125°, |b|<5°) and outer (125°<l<235°, |b|<5°) Galactic plane are detected with 29.1σ and 12.7σ significance, respectively. The outer Galactic plane diffuse emission is detected for the first time in the very- to ultra-high-energy domain (E>10  TeV). The energy spectrum in the inner Galaxy regions can be described by a power-law function with an index of -2.99±0.04, which is different from the curved spectrum as expected from hadronic interactions between locally measured cosmic rays and the line-of-sight integrated gas content. Furthermore, the measured flux is higher by a factor of ∼3 than the prediction. A similar spectrum with an index of -2.99±0.07 is found in the outer Galaxy region, and the absolute flux for 10≲E≲60  TeV is again higher than the prediction for hadronic cosmic ray interactions. The latitude distributions of the diffuse emission are consistent with the gas distribution, while the longitude distributions show clear deviation from the gas distribution. The LHAASO measurements imply that either additional emission sources exist or cosmic ray intensities have spatial variations."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Joint Modelling of Spoken Language Understanding Tasks with Integrated Dialog History""?","Most human interactions occur in the form of spoken conversations where the semantic meaning of a given utterance depends on the context. Each utterance in spoken conversation can be represented by many semantic and speaker attributes, and there has been an interest in building Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems for automatically predicting these attributes. Recent work has shown that incorporating dialogue history can help advance SLU performance. However, separate models are used for each SLU task, leading to an increase in inference time and computation cost. Motivated by this, we aim to ask: can we jointly model all the SLU tasks while incorporating context to facilitate low-latency and lightweight inference? To answer this, we propose a novel model architecture that learns dialog context to jointly predict the intent, dialog act, speaker role, and emotion for the spoken utterance. Note that our joint prediction is based on an autoregressive model and we need to decide the prediction order of dialog attributes, which is not trivial. To mitigate the issue, we also propose an order agnostic training method. Our experiments show that our joint model achieves similar results to task-specific classifiers and can effectively integrate dialog context to further improve the SLU performance.1"

The pool of negative instances is usually larger than positive instances, thus making selecting the most informative negative instance critical for performance. Such a selection strategy for negative instances from each bag is an open problem that has not been well studied for weak-label learning. In this paper, we study several sampling strategies that can measure the usefulness of negative instances for weak-label learning and select them accordingly. We test our method on CIFAR-10 and AudioSet datasets and show that it improves the weak-label classification performance and reduces the computational cost compared to random sampling methods. Our work reveals that negative instances are not all equally irrelevant, and selecting them wisely can benefit weak-label learning."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Improving Language Models with Advantage-based Offline Policy Gradients""?","Language Models (LMs) achieve substantial language capabilities when finetuned using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality LM-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LoL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action, A-LoL allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM's internal sequence-level value estimate, A-LoL filters negative advantage (low-quality) data points during training, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LoL is an easy-to-implement LM training recipe that is sample-efficient and stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LoL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO) and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless Assistant (HHA), LMs trained with A-LoL methods achieve the highest diversity while also being rated more safe and helpful than baselines according to humans. Additionally, in the remaining three tasks, A-LoL could optimize multiple distinct reward functions even when using noisy or suboptimal training data. We also release our experimental code. https://github.com/abaheti95/LoL-RL"

The model is trained to perform TSE if the target speaker cue is given and SS otherwise. By training the model to remove noise and reverberation, we allow the model to tackle the five tasks mentioned above with a single model, which has not been accomplished yet.

Several types of immune cells are involved in the pathogenesis of OLP. Methods We used single-cell RNA sequencing and immune repertoire sequencing to characterize the mucosal immune microenvironment of OLP. The presence of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells are validated by multiplex immunofluorescence. Results We generated a transcriptome atlas from four OLP biopsy samples and their paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and compared them with two healthy tissues and three healthy PBMCs samples. Our analysis revealed activated tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells in OLP tissues. T cell receptor repertoires displayed apperant clonal expansion and preferrential gene pairing in OLP patients. Additionally, obvious BCR clonal expansion was observed in OLP lesions. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells, a subtype that can promote dendritic cell maturation and enhance lymphocyte cytotoxicity, were identified in OLP. Conventional dendritic cells and macrophages are also found to exhibit pro-inflammatory activity in OLP. Cell-cell communication analysis reveals that fibroblasts might promote the recruitment and extravasation of immune cells into connective tissue.

However, because energy-based LMs are globally normalized, approximate techniques like Metropolis-Hastings (MH) are required for inference. Past work has largely explored simple proposal distributions that modify a single token at a time, like in Gibbs sampling. In this paper, we develop a novel MH sampler that, in contrast, proposes re-writes of the entire sequence in each step via iterative prompting of a large language model. Our new sampler (a) allows for more efficient and accurate sampling from a target distribution and (b) allows generation length to be determined through the sampling procedure rather than fixed in advance, as past work has required. We perform experiments on two controlled generation tasks, showing both downstream performance gains and more accurate target distribution sampling in comparison with single-token proposal techniques."

These approaches have led to the development of versatile models capable of tackling a wide array of tasks, while delivering state-of-the-art performance.

We introduce Pengi, a novel Audio Language Model that leverages Transfer Learning by framing all audio tasks as text-generation tasks. It takes as input, an audio recording, and text, and generates free-form text as output. The input audio is represented as a sequence of continuous embeddings by an audio encoder. A text encoder does the same for the corresponding text input. Both sequences are combined as a prefix to prompt a pre-trained frozen language model. The unified architecture of Pengi enables open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks without any additional fine-tuning or task-specific extensions. When evaluated on 22 downstream tasks, our approach yields state-of-the-art performance in several of them.

Some of these formats are human readable; others are machine readable. Some are easy to edit with general-purpose tools.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""3D Semantic Segmentation in the Wild: Learning Generalized Models for Adverse-Condition Point Clouds""?","Robust point cloud parsing under all-weather conditions is crucial to level-5 autonomy in autonomous driving. However, how to learn a universal 3D semantic segmentation (3DSS) model is largely neglected as most existing benchmarks are dominated by point clouds captured under normal weather. We introduce SemanticSTF, an adverse-weather point cloud dataset that provides dense point-level annotations and allows to study 3DSS under various adverse weather conditions. We study all-weather 3DSS modeling under two setups: 1) domain adaptive 3DSS that adapts from normal-weather data to adverse-weather data; 2) domain generalizable 3DSS that learns all-weather 3DSS models from normal-weather data. Our studies reveal the challenge while existing 3DSS methods encounter adverse-weather data, showing the great value of SemanticSTF in steering the future endeavor along this very meaningful research direction. In addition, we design a domain randomization technique that alternatively randomizes the geometry styles of point clouds and aggregates their embeddings, ultimately leading to a generalizable model that can improve 3DSS under various adverse weather effectively. The SemanticSTF and related codes are available at https://github.com/xiaoaoran/SemanticSTF."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Data-efficient Active Learning for Structured Prediction with Partial Annotation and Self-Training""?","In this work we propose a pragmatic method that reduces the annotation cost for structured label spaces using active learning. Our approach leverages partial annotation, which reduces labeling costs for structured outputs by selecting only the most informative sub-structures for annotation. We also utilize self-training to incorporate the current model's automatic predictions as pseudo-labels for un-annotated sub-structures. A key challenge in effectively combining partial annotation with self-training to reduce annotation cost is determining which sub-structures to select to label. To address this challenge, we adopt an error estimator to adaptively decide the partial selection ratio according to the current model's capability. In evaluations spanning four structured prediction tasks, we show that our combination of partial annotation and self-training using an adaptive selection ratio reduces annotation cost over strong full annotation baselines under a fair comparison scheme that takes reading time into consideration."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Towards Improved Identification of Vertebral Fractures in Routine Computed Tomography (CT) Scans: Development and External Validation of a Machine Learning Algorithm""?","Vertebral fractures (VFs) are the hallmark of osteoporosis, being one of the most frequent types of fragility fracture and an early sign of the disease. They are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. VFs are incidentally found in one out of five imaging studies, however, more than half of the VFs are not identified nor reported in patient computed tomography (CT) scans. Our study aimed to develop a machine learning algorithm to identify VFs in abdominal/chest CT scans and evaluate its performance. We acquired two independent data sets of routine abdominal/chest CT scans of patients aged 50 years or older: a training set of 1011 scans from a non‐interventional, prospective proof‐of‐concept study at the Universitair Ziekenhuis (UZ) Brussel and a validation set of 2000 subjects from an observational cohort study at the Hospital of Holbæk. Both data sets were externally reevaluated to identify reference standard VF readings using the Genant semiquantitative (SQ) grading. Four independent models have been trained in a cross‐validation experiment using the training set and an ensemble of four models has been applied to the external validation set. The validation set contained 15.3% scans with one or more VF (SQ2‐3), whereas 663 of 24,930 evaluable vertebrae (2.7%) were fractured (SQ2‐3) as per reference standard readings. Comparison of the ensemble model with the reference standard readings in identifying subjects with one or more moderate or severe VF resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85–0.90), accuracy of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.91–0.93), kappa of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.67–0.76), sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76–0.85), and specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93–0.96). We demonstrated that a machine learning algorithm trained for VF detection achieved strong performance on an external validation set. It has the potential to support healthcare professionals with the early identification of VFs and prevention of future fragility fractures. © 2023 UCB S.A. and The Authors.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""De novo assembling a high-quality genome sequence of Amur grape (Vitis amurensis Rupr.) gives insight into Vitis divergence and sex determination""?","To date, there is no high-quality sequence for genomes of the East Asian grape species, hindering biological and breeding research efforts to improve grape cultivars. This study presents a ∼522 Mb of the Vitis amurensis (Va) genome sequence containing 27,635 coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that V. riparia (Vr) may firstly split from the other two species, Va, V. Vinifera (Vv; Pinot Noir: PN40024 and Cabernet Sauvignon). Much divergent gene reservation among three grape duplicated gene sets suggests that the core eudicot common hexaploidy (ECH), 130 million years ago (Mya), has still played a non-negligible role in grape species divergence and biological innovation. Prominent accumulation of sequence variants might have improved cold resistance in Va, resulting in a more robust cold resistance gene regulatory network than those in Vv and Vr. In contrast, Va preserved much fewer NBS disease resistance genes than the other grapes. Notably, multi-omics analysis identified one trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase gene positively correlated to the resveratrol accumulated during Va berry development. A selective sweep analysis revealed a hypothetical Va sex-determination region (SDR). Besides, a PPR-containing protein-coding gene in the hypothetical SDR may be related with sex determination in Va. The content and arrangement order of genes in the putative SDR of female Va were similar to the SDR of female Vv. However, the putative SDR of female Va lost one Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO) and contained one extra uncharacterized protein-coding gene. These findings will improve the understanding of Vitis biology and contribute to the improvement of grape breeding."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Does compressing activations help model parallel training?""?","Large-scale Transformer models are known for their exceptional performance in a range of tasks, but training them can be difficult due to the requirement for communication-intensive model parallelism. One way to improve training speed is to compress the message size in communication. Previous approaches have primarily focused on compressing gradients in a data parallelism setting, but compression in a model-parallel setting is an understudied area. We have discovered that model parallelism has fundamentally different characteristics than data parallelism. In this work, we present the first empirical study on the effectiveness of compression methods for model parallelism. We implement and evaluate three common classes of compression algorithms - pruning-based, learning-based, and quantization-based - using a popular Transformer training framework. We evaluate these methods across more than 160 settings and 8 popular datasets, taking into account different hyperparameters, hardware, and both fine-tuning and pre-training stages. We also provide analysis when the model is scaled up. Finally, we provide insights for future development of model parallelism compression algorithms."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Inference-Time Policy Adapters (IPA): Tailoring Extreme-Scale LMs without Fine-tuning""?","While extreme-scale language models have demonstrated exceptional performance on a variety of language tasks, the degree of control over these language models through pure prompting can often be limited. Directly fine-tuning such language models can be effective for tailoring them, but it can be either extremely costly (e.g., GPT-3) or not even feasible for the broader community (e.g., GPT-4). We propose Inference-time Policy Adapters (IPA), which efficiently tailors a language model such as GPT-3 without fine-tuning it. IPA guides a large base model during decoding time through a lightweight policy adapter trained to optimize an arbitrary user objective with reinforcement learning. On five challenging text generation tasks, such as toxicity reduction and lexically constrained generation, IPA consistently brings significant improvements over off-the-shelf language models. It outperforms competitive baseline methods, sometimes even including expensive fine-tuning. In particular, tailoring GPT-2 with IPA can outperform GPT-3, while tailoring GPT-3 with IPA brings a major performance boost over GPT-3 (and sometimes even over GPT-4). Our promising results highlight the potential of IPA as a lightweight alternative to tailoring extreme-scale language models."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Coverage and impact of influenza vaccination among children in Minhang District, China, 2013–2020""?","Background Young children have a great disease burden and are particularly vulnerable to influenza. This study aimed to assess the direct effect of influenza vaccination among children and to evaluate the indirect benefit of immunizing children. Methods The influenza vaccination records for all children born during 2013–2019 in Minhang District and surveillance data for reported influenza cases were obtained from the Minhang CDC. 17,905 children were recorded in the vaccination system and included in this study. Descriptive epidemiology methods were used for data analysis, including an ecological approach to estimate the number of influenza cases averted by vaccination and linear regression to estimate the reduction in influenza cases in the general population per thousand additional childhood vaccination doses. Results During the study period, the annual vaccination coverage rate ranged from 10.40% in 2013–2014 to 27.62% in 2015–2016. The estimated number of influenza cases averted by vaccination ranged from a low of 0.28 (range: 0.23–0.34) during 2013–2014 (PF: 6.15%, range: 5.11–7.38%) to a high of 15.34 (range: 12.38–18.51) during 2017–2018 (PF: 16.54%, range: 13.79–19.30%). When increasing vaccination coverage rate by 10% in each town/street, a ratio of 7.27–10.69% cases could be further averted on the basis of observed cases. In four selected periods, the number of influenza cases in the general population was most significantly correlated with the cumulative childhood vaccination doses in the prior 2–5 months, and the reduction in influenza cases ranged from 0.73 to 3.18 cases per thousand additional childhood vaccination doses. Conclusion Influenza vaccination among children is estimated to have direct effects in terms of averted cases and might provide an underlying indirect benefit to the general population. Vaccination coverage in high-coverage areas should be further expanded to avert more influenza cases."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Representation Learning for Interpersonal and Multimodal Behavior Dynamics: A Multiview Extension of Latent Change Score Models""?","Characterizing the dynamics of behavior across multiple modalities and individuals is a vital component of computational behavior analysis. This is especially important in certain applications, such as psychotherapy, where individualized tracking of behavior patterns can provide valuable information about the patient’s mental state. Conventional methods that rely on aggregate statistics and correlational metrics may not always suffice, as they are often unable to capture causal relationships or evaluate the true probability of identified patterns. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach to learning multimodal and interpersonal representations of behavior dynamics during one-on-one interaction. Our approach is enabled by the introduction of a multiview extension of latent change score models, which facilitates the concurrent capture of both inter-modal and interpersonal behavior dynamics and the identification of directional relationships between them. A core advantage of our approach is its high level of interpretability while simultaneously achieving strong predictive performance. We evaluate our approach within the domain of therapist-client interactions, with the objective of gaining a deeper understanding about the collaborative relationship between the two, a crucial element of the therapeutic process. Our results demonstrate improved performance over conventional approaches that rely upon summary statistics or correlational metrics. Furthermore, since our multiview approach includes the explicit modeling of uncertainty, it naturally lends itself to integration with probabilistic classifiers, such as Gaussian process models. We demonstrate that this integration leads to even further improved performance, all the while maintaining highly interpretable qualities. Our analysis provides compelling motivation for further exploration of stochastic systems within computational models of behavior."

In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time; this way, we can index practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization benchmarks, showing that it can process even 500k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time. We demonstrate that Unlimiformer improves pretrained models such as BART and Longformer by extending them to unlimited inputs without additional learned weights and without modifying their code. We make our code and models publicly available at https://github.com/abertsch72/unlimiformer ."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Associations of Morphological Changes in Skeletal Muscles of Preschool Children in China Following Physical Activity""?","Purpose: Physical activity (PA) is likely to be the most important modifiable factor in skeletal muscle development. However, the influence of PA on the skeletal muscle of preschool children has not been thoroughly investigated. The main objective of this study was to quantitatively measure PA, and then, to assess whether associations exist between site-specific muscle changes and PA in relation to sex and weight statuses in preschool children aged 3 to 4 years. Methods: A total of 86 healthy preschool children, aged 3–4 years, were instructed to wear an accelerometer for seven consecutive days. The number of steps taken daily, and minutes spent in moderate–vigorous PA (MVPA) and total PA (TPA) were recorded. Muscle thickness was measured by B-mode ultrasonography using a 5–18 MHz scanning head. Muscle thickness was measured at seven sites: the lateral forearm, upper arm, abdomen, anterior and posterior thigh, and anterior and posterior lower leg. Results: There was no significant difference between boys and girls in terms of MVPA and TPA on weekdays and weekends. According to the linear regression models, after adjusting for daylight duration, the muscle of the posterior thigh was significantly positively associated (p < 0.05) with daily steps and MVPA on weekdays for boys and girls, respectively. Conclusions: We found that the muscle thickness of the posterior thigh in preschool children was significantly positively associated with PA, as measured by daily steps and MVPA. We suggest that for the overall health and well-being of preschool children, the levels of PA should be maintained and/or increased, and preferably transformed into a regular part of daily living."

However, such benefits face a large perceptual challenge when being implemented in practice, due to the different ways occupants working in the buildings understand and trust in the data collection. The semi-public, pervasive, and multi-modal nature of data collection in smart buildings points to the need to study occupants’ understanding of data collection and notification preferences. We conduct an online study with 492 participants in the US who report working in smart commercial buildings regarding: 1) awareness and perception of data collection in smart commercial buildings, 2) privacy notification preferences, and 3) potential factors for privacy notification preferences. We find that around half of the participants are not fully aware of the data collection and use practices of IoT even though they notice the presence of IoT devices and sensors. We also discover many misunderstandings around different data practices. The majority of participants want to be notified of data practices in smart buildings, and they prefer push notifications to passive ones such as websites or physical signs. Surprisingly, mobile app notification, despite being a popular channel for smart homes, is the least preferred method for smart commercial buildings."

In response, we introduce Adaptive-Consistency, a cost-efficient, model-agnostic technique that dynamically adjusts the number of samples per question using a lightweight stopping criterion.

However, even if hyperbolic embeddings have gathered attention in image recognition, their optimization is prone to numerical hurdles. Further, it remains unclear which applications stand to benefit the most from the implicit bias imposed by hyperbolicity, when compared to traditional Euclidean features. In this paper, we focus on prototypical hyperbolic neural networks. In particular, the tendency of hyperbolic embeddings to converge to the boundary of the Poincar\'e ball in high dimensions and the effect this has on few-shot classification. We show that the best few-shot results are attained for hyperbolic embeddings at a common hyperbolic radius. In contrast to prior benchmark results, we demonstrate that better performance can be achieved by a fixed-radius encoder equipped with the Euclidean metric, regardless of the embedding dimension."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Amortizing Pragmatic Program Synthesis with Rankings""?","In program synthesis, an intelligent system takes in a set of user-generated examples and returns a program that is logically consistent with these examples. The usage of Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework has been successful in building \emph{pragmatic} program synthesizers that return programs which -- in addition to being logically consistent -- account for the fact that a user chooses their examples informatively. However, the computational burden of running the RSA algorithm has restricted the application of pragmatic program synthesis to domains with a small number of possible programs. This work presents a novel method of amortizing the RSA algorithm by leveraging a \emph{global pragmatic ranking} -- a single, total ordering of all the hypotheses. We prove that for a pragmatic synthesizer that uses a single demonstration, our global ranking method exactly replicates RSA's ranked responses. We further empirically show that global rankings effectively approximate the full pragmatic synthesizer in an online, multi-demonstration setting. Experiments on two program synthesis domains using our pragmatic ranking method resulted in orders of magnitudes of speed ups compared to the RSA synthesizer, while outperforming the standard, non-pragmatic synthesizer."

However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress."

This paper addresses the challenge of tail label prediction by leveraging the power of dense neural retrieval model in mapping input documents (as queries) to relevant label descriptions. To further enhance the quality of label descriptions, we propose to generate pseudo label descriptions from a trained bag-of-words (BoW) classifier, which demonstrates better classification performance under severe scarce data conditions.The proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of overall label prediction on XMTC benchmark datasets and especially outperforms the SOTA models in the tail label prediction.

Conversely, label-based attention encoder-decoder mitigates this issue using soft attention to the input, while it tends to overestimate labels biased towards its training domain, unlike CTC. We exploit these complementary attributes and propose to integrate the frame- and label-synchronous (F-/L-Sync) decoding alternately performed within a single beam-search scheme. F-Sync decoding leads the decoding for block-wise processing, while L-Sync decoding provides the prioritized hypotheses using look-ahead future frames within a block. We maintain the hypotheses from both decoding methods to perform effective pruning.

However, as the raw data quality deteriorates, the implicit functions often lead to unsatisfactory reconstruction results. To this end, we propose a novel edge-preserving implicit surface reconstruction method, which mainly consists of a differentiable Laplican regularizer and a dynamic edge sampling strategy. Among them, the differential Laplican regularizer can effectively alleviate the implicit surface unsmoothness caused by the point cloud quality deteriorates; Meanwhile, in order to reduce the excessive smoothing at the edge regions of implicit suface, we proposed a dynamic edge extract strategy for sampling near the sharp edge of point cloud, which can effectively avoid the Laplacian regularizer from smoothing all regions. Finally, we combine them with a simple regularization term for robust implicit surface reconstruction. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of 3D reconstruction results.

Furthermore, the cake layer resistance (reversible fouling) contributed to 95.93% of the total filtration resistance, thus a simple physical cleaning can effectively restore the flux indicating a low-maintenance requirement.

Consequently, text generated by LLMs can inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes towards marginalized groups, like the LGBTQIA+ community. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of how LLMs generate text describing people with different sexual identities. Analyzing bias in the text generated by an LLM using regard score shows measurable bias against queer people. We then show that a post-hoc method based on chain-of-thought prompting using SHAP analysis can increase the regard of the sentence, representing a promising approach towards debiasing the output of LLMs in this setting."

Our system builds on our previous submission at the Second Clarity Enhancement Challenge (CEC2): iNeuBe-X, which consists in an iterative neural/conventional beamforming enhancement pipeline, guided by an enrollment utterance from the target speaker. This model, which won by a large margin the CEC2, is an extension of the state-of-the-art TF-GridNet model for multi-channel, streamable target-speaker speech enhancement. Here, this approach is extended and further improved by leveraging generative adversarial training, which we show proves especially useful when the training data is limited. Using only the official 6k training scenes data, our best model achieves 0.80 hearing-aid speech perception index (HASPI) and 0.41 hearing-aid speech quality index (HASQI) scores on the synthetic evaluation set. However, our model generalized poorly on the semi-real evaluation set. This highlights the fact that our community should focus more on real-world evaluation and less on fully synthetic datasets."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Exploring Speech Recognition, Translation, and Understanding with Discrete Speech Units: A Comparative Study""?","Speech signals, typically sampled at rates in the tens of thousands per second, contain redundancies, evoking inefficiencies in sequence modeling. High-dimensional speech features such as spectrograms are often used as the input for the subsequent model. However, they can still be redundant. Recent investigations proposed the use of discrete speech units derived from self-supervised learning representations, which significantly compresses the size of speech data. Applying various methods, such as de-duplication and subword modeling, can further compress the speech sequence length. Hence, training time is significantly reduced while retaining notable performance. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive and systematic exploration into the application of discrete units within end-to-end speech processing models. Experiments on 12 automatic speech recognition, 3 speech translation, and 1 spoken language understanding corpora demonstrate that discrete units achieve reasonably good results in almost all the settings.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Efficient Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos with Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation""?","Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos (TSGV) aims to detect the event timestamps described by the natural language query from untrimmed videos. This paper discusses the challenge of achieving efficient computation in TSGV models while maintaining high performance. Most existing approaches exquisitely design complex architectures to improve accuracy with extra layers and loss, suffering from inefficiency and heaviness. Although some works have noticed that, they only make an issue of feature fusion layers, which can hardly enjoy the highspeed merit in the whole clunky network. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel efficient multi-teacher model (EMTM) based on knowledge distillation to transfer diverse knowledge from both heterogeneous and isomorphic networks. Specifically, We first unify different outputs of the heterogeneous models into one single form. Next, a Knowledge Aggregation Unit (KAU) is built to acquire high-quality integrated soft labels from multiple teachers. After that, the KAU module leverages the multi-scale video and global query information to adaptively determine the weights of different teachers. A Shared Encoder strategy is then proposed to solve the problem that the student shallow layers hardly benefit from teachers, in which an isomorphic teacher is collaboratively trained with the student to align their hidden states. Extensive experimental results on three popular TSGV benchmarks demonstrate that our method is both effective and efficient without bells and whistles."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Accuracy of narrow band imaging for detecting the malignant transformation of oral potentially malignant disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis""?","Objective Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) are a spectrum of diseases that harbor the potential of malignant transformation and developing into oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Narrow band imaging (NBI) has been clinically utilized for the adjuvant diagnosis of OPMD and OSCC. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of NBI for malignant transformations of OPMD by applying the intraepithelial papillary capillary loop (IPCL) classification approach. Methods Studies reporting the diagnostic validity of NBI in the detection of OPMD/OSCC were selected. Four databases were searched and 11 articles were included in the meta-analysis. We performed four subgroup analyses by defining IPCL I/II as negative diagnostic results and no/mild dysplasia as negative pathological outcome. Pooled data were analyzed using random-effects models. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore heterogeneity. Results After pooled analysis of the four subgroups, we found that subgroup 1, defining IPCL II and above as a clinically positive result, demonstrated the most optimal overall diagnostic accuracy for the malignant transformation of OPMDs, with a sensitivity and specificity of NBI of 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.67, 0.96], p < 0.001) and 0.83 [95% CI (0.56, 0.95), p < 0.001], respectively; while the other 3 subgroups displayed relatively low sensitivity or specificity. Conclusions NBI is a promising and non-invasive adjunctive tool for identifying malignant transformations of OPMDs. The IPCL grading is currently a sound criterion for the clinical application of NBI. After excluding potentially false positive results, these oral lesions classified as IPCL II or above are suggested to undergo biopsy for early and accurate diagnosis as well as management."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""BotPercent: Estimating Twitter Bot Populations from Groups to Crowds""?","Twitter bot detection has become increasingly important in combating misinformation, identifying malicious online cam-paigns, and protecting the integrity of social media discourse. While existing bot detection literature mostly focuses on identifying individual bots, it remains underexplored how to estimate the proportion of bots within speciﬁc communities and social networks, which has great implications for both content moderators and day-to-day users. In this work, we propose community-level bot detection , a novel approach to estimating the amount of malicious interference in online communities by estimating the percentage of bot accounts. Speciﬁcally, we introduce BotPercent , an amalgamation of Twitter bot-detection datasets and feature, text, and graph-based models that overcome generalization issues in existing individual-level models, resulting in a more accurate community-level bot estimation. Experiments demonstrate that BotPercent achieves state-of-the-art community-level bot detection performance on the TwiBot-22 benchmark while showing great robustness towards the tampering of speciﬁc user features. Armed with BotPercent , we analyze bot rates in different Twitter groups and communities, such as all active Twitter users, users that interact with partisan news media, users that participate in Elon Musk’s content moderation votes, and the political communities in different countries and regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that the existence of Twitter bots is not homogeneous, but rather a spatial-temporal distribution whose heterogeneity should be taken into account for content moderation, social media policy making, and more.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Regularizing Self-training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Structural Constraints""?","Self-training based on pseudo-labels has emerged as a dominant approach for addressing conditional distribution shifts in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation problems. A notable drawback, however, is that this family of approaches is susceptible to erroneous pseudo labels that arise from confirmation biases in the source domain and that manifest as nuisance factors in the target domain. A possible source for this mismatch is the reliance on only photometric cues provided by RGB image inputs, which may ultimately lead to sub-optimal adaptation. To mitigate the effect of mismatched pseudo-labels, we propose to incorporate structural cues from auxiliary modalities, such as depth, to regularise conventional self-training objectives. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive pixel-level objectness constraint that pulls the pixel representations within a region of an object instance closer, while pushing those from different object categories apart. To obtain object regions consistent with the true underlying object, we extract information from both depth maps and RGB-images in the form of multimodal clustering. Crucially, the objectness constraint is agnostic to the ground-truth semantic labels and, hence, appropriate for unsupervised domain adaptation. In this work, we show that our regularizer significantly improves top performing self-training methods (by up to $2$ points) in various UDA benchmarks for semantic segmentation. We include all code in the supplementary."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Resolving Knowledge Conflicts in Large Language Models""?","Large language models (LLMs) often encounter knowledge conflicts, scenarios where discrepancy arises between the internal parametric knowledge of LLMs and non-parametric information provided in the prompt context. In this work we ask what are the desiderata for LLMs when a knowledge conflict arises and whether existing LLMs fulfill them. We posit that LLMs should 1) identify knowledge conflicts, 2) pinpoint conflicting information segments, and 3) provide distinct answers or viewpoints in conflicting scenarios. To this end, we introduce KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT, an evaluation framework for simulating contextual knowledge conflicts and quantitatively evaluating to what extent LLMs achieve these goals. KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT includes diverse and complex situations of knowledge conflict, knowledge from diverse entities and domains, two synthetic conflict creation methods, and settings with progressively increasing difficulty to reflect realistic knowledge conflicts. Extensive experiments with the KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT framework reveal that while LLMs perform well in identifying the existence of knowledge conflicts, they struggle to determine the specific conflicting knowledge and produce a response with distinct answers amidst conflicting information. To address these challenges, we propose new instruction-based approaches that augment LLMs to better achieve the three goals. Further analysis shows that abilities to tackle knowledge conflicts are greatly impacted by factors such as knowledge domain and prompt text, while generating robust responses to knowledge conflict scenarios remains an open research question."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""FindAdaptNet: Find and Insert Adapters by Learned Layer Importance""?","Adapters are lightweight bottleneck modules introduced to assist pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models to be customized to new tasks. However, searching the appropriate layers to insert adapters on large models has become difficult due to the large number of possible layers and thus a vast search space (2N possibilities for N layers). In this paper, we propose a technique that achieves automatic insertion of adapters for downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks. Our approach is based on two-stage training. First, we train our model for a specific downstream task with additional shallow learnable layers and weight parameters to obtain the weighted summation over the output of each layer in SSL. This training method is established by the SUPERB baseline [1]. This first-stage training determines the most important layers given their respective weights. In the second stage, we proceed to insert adapters to the most important layers, retaining both performance and neural architecture search efficiency. On the CommonVoice dataset[2] we obtain 20.6% absolute improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) on the Welsh language against the conventional method, which inserts the adapter modules into the highest layers without search. In the SLURP SLU task, our method yields 4.0% intent accuracy improvement against the same conventional baseline."

The Jigsaw approach, a model of co operative learning, focuses on learning in groups with fellow learner co operation and reassures team work. Thus, this study was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of jigsaw strategy in comparison to tutorials in enhancing cognitive skills among the medical students in microbiology. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out at microbiology department for 50 consenting MBBS students of professional year II and 50 consenting B.Sc nursing students of 2nd years. Students were randomly divided into two batches: Aand B of 25 students each. They were prepared for either a jigsaw (Experimental) or tutorial (Control) a week prior on predecided topics. The same groups were crossed over for another topic. Students' performance was assessed by pretest, posttest, academic achievement level, and retention test by prevalidated multiple choice questionnaires. The student perception on TL methods was evaluated by using learning experience questionnaires. Results: Posttest scores of both groups were found to be significant at the level of P < 0.05. Among medical students, mean of posttest scores in the jigsaw is more than tutorial (12.4 v/s 9.7, crossover 13.3 v/s 11.2) and in nursing students (11.7 v/s 8.2, crossover 11.6 v/s 9.9). Mean retention tests scores and absolute achievement level were high in jigsaw groups. The students preferred jigsaw over the tutorial. Conclusion: Jigsaw strategy is a robust instructional tool, well perceived by the students to enhance cognitive skills as inferred by the results and can be tailored to the needs of varied topics across different disciplines."

The goal of PSL is to learn a pairwise similarity function assigning a higher similarity score to positive pairs (i.e., a pair of samples with the same label) than to negative pairs (i.e., a pair of samples with different label). We start by identifying a key desideratum for PSL, and then discuss how existing methods can achieve this desideratum. We then propose a surprisingly simple proxy-free method, called SimPLE, which requires neither feature/proxy normalization nor angular margin and yet is able to generalize well in open-set recognition. We apply the proposed method to three challenging PSL tasks: open-set face recognition, image retrieval and speaker verification.

In this work, we propose ORCA, a general cross-modal fine-tuning framework that extends the applicability of a single large-scale pretrained model to diverse modalities. ORCA adapts to a target task via an align-then-refine workflow: given the target input, ORCA first learns an embedding network that aligns the embedded feature distribution with the pretraining modality. The pretrained model is then fine-tuned on the embedded data to exploit the knowledge shared across modalities. Through extensive experiments, we show that ORCA obtains state-of-the-art results on 3 benchmarks containing over 60 datasets from 12 modalities, outperforming a wide range of hand-designed, AutoML, general-purpose, and task-specific methods.

Furthermore, these cells displayed enhanced cytokine production, including IFN-γ (Interferon-gamma, a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule), TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, a cytokine regulating inflammation), and IL-17 (Interleukin-17, a cytokine involved in immune response modulation), in patients with EOLP. And our clinical cohort of 1-year follow-up was also supported the above results in RNA level and protein level.

However, while most approaches randomly mask tokens, there is strong intuition that deciding what to mask can substantially improve learning outcomes. We investigate this in continued pretraining setting in which pretrained models continue to pretrain on domain-specific data before performing some downstream task. We introduce Difference-Masking, a masking strategy that automatically chooses what to mask during continued pretraining by considering what makes a task domain different from the pretraining domain. Empirically, we find that Difference-Masking outperforms baselines on continued pretraining settings across four diverse language-only and multimodal video tasks."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""A Wideband Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for 5G Millimeter-Wave Applications""?","Despite the growing interest in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands, and the considerable theoretical work reported by the communication community, there is a limited number of published works demonstrating practical implementations and experimental results. To the authors' knowledge, no published literature has reported experimental results for RISs covering the n257 and n258 mm-wave bands. In this work, we propose a novel wideband RIS design that covers the entire mm-wave 5G n257 and n258 bands. In simulations, the unit cell can maintain a phase difference of 180{\deg} +- 20{\deg} and a reflection magnitude greater than -2.8 dB within 22.7 to 30.5 GHz (29.3% bandwidth) using one-bit PIN switches. The proposed unit cell design with four circular cutouts and long vias could realize wideband performance by exciting two adjacent high-order resonances (2.5f and 3.5f). The periodic unit cells can maintain an angular stability of 30{\deg}. Based on the proposed unit cell, a 20 by 20 RIS array is designed and fabricated with a size of 7.1{\lambda} by 7.1{\lambda}. The measurement results demonstrate that the proposed RIS could maintain a 3 dB peak gain variation bandwidth among various array configurations within 22.5 to 29.5 GHz (26.9%) and with a beam scanning capability of 50{\deg}, making this design a good candidate for 5G mm-wave applications."

To effectively use LLMs for visual generation, one crucial component is the visual tokenizer that maps pixel-space inputs to discrete tokens appropriate for LLM learning. In this paper, we introduce MAGVIT-v2, a video tokenizer designed to generate concise and expressive tokens for both videos and images using a common token vocabulary. Equipped with this new tokenizer, we show that LLMs outperform diffusion models on standard image and video generation benchmarks including ImageNet and Kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that our tokenizer surpasses the previously top-performing video tokenizer on two more tasks: (1) video compression comparable to the next-generation video codec (VCC) according to human evaluations, and (2) learning effective representations for action recognition tasks."

We use fully unpaired data to train our unsupervised systems and evaluate our results on CoVoST 2 and CVSS. The results show that our work is comparable with some other early supervised methods in some language pairs. While cascaded systems always suffer from severe error propagation problems, we proposed denoising back-translation (DBT), a novel approach to building robust unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT). DBT successfully increases the BLEU score by 0.7--0.9 in all three translation directions. Moreover, we simplified the pipeline of our cascaded system to reduce inference latency and conducted a comprehensive analysis of every part of our work.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""An Experimental Study on Secondary Transfer Performances of Prestress after Anchoring Failure of Steel Wire Strands""?","To understand the secondary transfer performances of residual prestress after the anchoring failure of end-anchored steel wire strands due to corrosion fracture, six steel wire strand components of post-tensioning prestress were designed and fabricated. One-side fast corrosion was applied to the steel wire strand components using the electrochemical method until anchoring failure was reached. The sphere of influence, stress changes, and the retraction and swelling effect of broken beams after failure were investigated. The influences of factors such as concrete strength, stirrup area, and the length of the component on the secondary transfer length of residual prestress were discussed. Based on the deformation relationship between prestressed steel wire strands and concrete in the stress transfer zone, a stress equation was established and solved through a bond constitutive model. A prediction model of the effective stress transfer length of prestressed steel wire strand after failure was proposed. The results demonstrated that residual prestress can have a secondary transfer after the corrosion fracture of end-anchored steel wire strands, but some effective prestress may be lost. Moreover, the loss of prestress is inversely proportional to concrete compressive strength. When the specimens are relatively short, the prestress loss increases significantly. Concrete strength has significant influences on the length of secondary transfer. The proposed simplified calculation method of the secondary transfer length of residual prestress has a relatively high accuracy, with an average error of 2.9% and a maximum error of 5.2%."

In this paper, we first revisit the popular pseudo-labeling methods via a unified sample weighting formulation and demonstrate the inherent quantity-quality trade-off problem of pseudo-labeling with thresholding, which may prohibit learning. To this end, we propose SoftMatch to overcome the trade-off by maintaining both high quantity and high quality of pseudo-labels during training, effectively exploiting the unlabeled data. We derive a truncated Gaussian function to weight samples based on their confidence, which can be viewed as a soft version of the confidence threshold. We further enhance the utilization of weakly-learned classes by proposing a uniform alignment approach. In experiments, SoftMatch shows substantial improvements across a wide variety of benchmarks, including image, text, and imbalanced classification."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents""?","With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Fully Unsupervised Topic Clustering of Unlabelled Spoken Audio Using Self-Supervised Representation Learning and Topic Model""?","Unsupervised topic clustering of spoken audio is an important research topic for zero-resourced unwritten languages. A classical approach is to find a set of spoken terms from only the audio based on dynamic time warping or generative modeling (e.g., hidden Markov model), and apply a topic model to classify topics. The spoken term discovery is the most important and difficult part. In this paper, we propose to combine self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) methods as a component of spoken term discovery and probabilistic topic models. Most SSRL methods pre-train a model which predicts high-quality pseudo labels generated from an audio-only corpus. These pseudo labels can be used to produce a sequence of pseudo subwords by applying deduplication and a subword model. Then, we apply a topic model based on latent Dirichlet allocation for these pseudo-subword sequences in an unsupervised manner. The clustering performance is evaluated on the Fisher corpus using normalized mutual information. We confirm the improvement of the proposed method and its effectiveness compared to an existing approach using dynamic time warping and topic models although the experimental setups are not directly comparable."

Across both seasons, 26 teams submitted forecasts, with the submitting teams varying between seasons. Forecast skill was evaluated using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS), relative WIS, and coverage.

Averaging across all forecast targets, the FluSight ensemble was the 2nd most accurate model measured by WIS in 2021-22 and the 5th most accurate in the 2022-23 season. Forecast skill and 95% coverage for the FluSight ensemble and most component models degraded over longer forecast horizons and during periods of rapid change.

While considerable progress has been made on estimating a single scalar quality score, current metrics lack the informativeness of more detailed schemes that annotate individual errors, such as Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). In this paper, we help fill this gap by proposing AutoMQM, a prompting technique which leverages the reasoning and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and asks them to identify and categorize errors in translations. We start by evaluating recent LLMs, such as PaLM and PaLM-2, through simple score prediction prompting, and we study the impact of labeled data through in-context learning and finetuning. We then evaluate AutoMQM with PaLM-2 models, and we find that it improves performance compared to just prompting for scores (with particularly large gains for larger models) while providing interpretability through error spans that align with human annotations."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Active Retrieval Augmented Generation""?","Despite the remarkable ability of large language models (LMs) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Auditing Gender Presentation Differences in Text-to-Image Models""?","Text-to-image models, which can generate high-quality images based on textual input, have recently enabled various content-creation tools. Despite significantly affecting a wide range of downstream applications, the distributions of these generated images are still not fully understood, especially when it comes to the potential stereotypical attributes of different genders. In this work, we propose a paradigm (Gender Presentation Differences) that utilizes fine-grained self-presentation attributes to study how gender is presented differently in text-to-image models. By probing gender indicators in the input text (e.g.,""a woman""or""a man""), we quantify the frequency differences of presentation-centric attributes (e.g.,""a shirt""and""a dress"") through human annotation and introduce a novel metric: GEP. Furthermore, we propose an automatic method to estimate such differences. The automatic GEP metric based on our approach yields a higher correlation with human annotations than that based on existing CLIP scores, consistently across three state-of-the-art text-to-image models. Finally, we demonstrate the generalization ability of our metrics in the context of gender stereotypes related to occupations."

With the resurged interest in LRNNs, we study whether they can learn the hidden rules in training sequences, such as the grammatical structures of regular language. We theoretically analyze some existing LRNNs and discover their limitations on regular language. Motivated by the analysis, we propose a new LRNN equipped with a block-diagonal and input-dependent transition matrix. Experiments suggest that the proposed model is the only LRNN that can perform length extrapolation on regular language tasks such as Sum, Even Pair, and Modular Arithmetic."

Without intervention, these social biases persist in the model's predictions in downstream tasks, leading to representational harm. Many strategies have been proposed to mitigate the effects of inappropriate social biases learned during pretraining. Simultaneously, methods for model compression have become increasingly popular to reduce the computational burden of LLMs. Despite the popularity and need for both approaches, little work has been done to explore the interplay between these two. We perform a carefully controlled study of the impact of model compression via quantization and knowledge distillation on measures of social bias in LLMs. Longer pretraining and larger models led to higher social bias, and quantization showed a regularizer effect with its best trade-off around 20% of the original pretraining time."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Multi-Omics Unravels Metabolic Alterations in the Ileal Mucosa of Neonatal Piglets Receiving Total Parenteral Nutrition""?","Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is life-saving therapy for the pediatric patients with intestinal failure (IF) who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition (EN). However, TPN-induced metabolic alterations are also a critical issue for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, and thus the global metabolomic signatures need to be addressed. In this study, ileal mucosal biopsies were collected from 12 neonatal Bama piglets receiving either EN or TPN for 14 days, and changes in the intestinal metabolism were examined by multi-omics (HM350 Metabolomics + Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based proteomics). As a result, a total of 240 compounds were identified by metabolomics, including 56 down-regulated and 9 up-regulated metabolites. Notably, tissue levels of fatty acyl-carnitines (decreased by 35–85%) and succinate (decreased by 89%) dramatically decreased in the TPN group, suggestive of disrupted processes of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and the citrate cycle, respectively. Interestingly, however, no differences were found in the production of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) between groups, suggesting that these dysregulated metabolites may have mainly led to the loss of bioactive compounds rather than energy deficit. Additionally, 4813 proteins were identified by proteomics in total, including 179 down-regulated and 329 up-regulated proteins. The analysis of protein–protein interactions (PPI) indicated that most of the differentially expressed proteins were clustered into “lipid metabolism” and “innate immune responses”. In summary, this work provided new findings in TPN-induced intestinal metabolic alterations, which would be useful to the improvement of nutritional management for IF patients."

Instead of a data augmentation approach, CounterComp is based on metric learning, which allows for direct sampling from the training set and circumvents the need for additional human labels. Our proposed auxiliary metric learning loss improves the performance of three state of the art models on four recently released datasets. We also show how the approach can improve OOD performance on unseen domains, as well as unseen compositions.

PSL subsumes a wide range of important applications, such as open-set face recognition, speaker verification, image retrieval and person re-identification. The goal of PSL is to learn a pairwise similarity function assigning a higher similarity score to positive pairs (i.e., a pair of samples with the same label) than to negative pairs (i.e., a pair of samples with different label). We start by identifying a key desideratum for PSL, and then discuss how existing methods can achieve this desideratum. We then propose a surprisingly simple proxy-free method, called SimPLE, which requires neither feature/proxy normalization nor angular margin and yet is able to generalize well in open-set recognition. We apply the proposed method to three challenging PSL tasks: open-set face recognition, image retrieval and speaker verification. Comprehensive experimental results on large-scale benchmarks show that our method performs significantly better than current state-of-the-art methods.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Diagnostic Performance of Multispectral SWIR Transillumination and Reflectance Imaging for Caries Detection""?",The aim of this clinical study was to compare the diagnostic performance of dual short wavelength infrared (SWIR) occlusal transillumination and reflectance multispectral imaging with conventional visual assessment and radiography for caries detection on premolars scheduled for extraction for orthodontics reasons. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) and micro-computed tomography (microCT) performed after tooth extraction were used as gold standards. The custom-fabricated imaging probe was 3D-printed and the imaging system employed a SWIR camera and fiber-optic light sources emitting light at 1300 nm for occlusal transillumination and 1600 nm for reflectance measurements. Teeth (n = 135) on 40 test subjects were imaged in vivo using the SWIR imaging prototype in the study and teeth were extracted after imaging. Our study demonstrates for the first time that near-simultaneous real-time transillumination and reflectance video can be successfully acquired for caries detection. Both SWIR imaging modalities had markedly higher sensitivity for lesions on proximal and occlusal surfaces compared to conventional methods (visual and radiographic). Reflectance imaging at 1600 nm had higher sensitivity and specificity than transillumination at 1300 nm. The combined SWIR methods yielded higher specificity but the combined sensitivity was lower than for each individual method.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Comparison of the structures and topologies of plasma extracted circulating nuclear and mitochondrial cell-free DNA""?","Introduction: The function, origin and structural features of circulating nuclear DNA (cir-nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (cir-mtDNA) are poorly known, even though they have been investigated in numerous clinical studies, and are involved in a number of routine clinical applications. Based on our previous report disproving the conventional plasma isolation used for cirDNA analysis, this work enables a direct topological comparison of the circulating structures associated with nuclear DNA and mitochondrial cell-free DNA. Materials and methods: We used a Q-PCR and low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) combination approach of cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA, extracted using a procedure that eliminates platelet activation during the plasma isolation process to prevent mitochondria release in the extracellular milieu. Various physical procedures, such as filtration and differential centrifugation, were employed to infer their circulating structures. Results: DSP-S cir-mtDNA mean size profiles distributed on a slightly shorter range than SSP-S. SSP-S detected 40-fold more low-sized cir-mtDNA fragments (<90 bp/nt) and three-fold less long-sized fragments (>200 bp/nt) than DSP-S. The ratio of the fragment number below 90 bp over the fragment number above 200 bp was very homogenous among both DSP-S and SSP-S profiles, being 134-fold lower with DSP-S than with SSP-S. Cir-mtDNA and cir-nDNA DSP-S and SSP-S mean size profiles of healthy individuals ranged in different intervals with periodic sub-peaks only detectable with cir-nDNA. The very low amount of cir-mtDNA fragments of short size observed suggested that most of the cir-mtDNA is poorly fragmented and appearing longer than ∼1,000 bp, the readout limit of this LP-WGS method. Data suggested that cir-nDNA is, among DNA extracted in plasma, associated with ∼8.6% of large structures (apoptotic bodies, large extracellular vesicles (EVs), cell debris…), ∼27.7% in chromatin and small EVs and ∼63.7% mainly in oligo- and mono-nucleosomes. By contrast, cir-mtDNA appeared to be preponderantly (75.7%) associated with extracellular mitochondria, either in its free form or with large EVs; to a lesser extent, it was also associated with other structures: small EVs (∼18.4%), and exosomes or protein complexes (∼5.9%). Conclusion: This is the first study to directly compare the structural features of cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA. The significant differences revealed between both are due to the DNA topological structure contained in the nucleus (chromatin) and in the mitochondria (plasmid) that determine their biological stability in blood. Although cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA are principally associated with mono-nucleosomes and cell-free mitochondria, our study highlights the diversity of the circulating structures associated with cell-free DNA. They consequently have different pharmacokinetics as well as physiological functions. Thus, any accurate evaluation of their biological or diagnostic individual properties must relies on appropriate pre-analytics, and optimally on the isolation or enrichment of one category of their cirDNA associated structures."

Our code and training optimizations make SSL feasible with only 8 GPUs, instead of the 32 used in the original work. We also explore a semi-supervised route, using an ASR model to skip the first pre-training iteration. Within one iteration of pre-training, our models improve over HuBERT on several tasks.

However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study to what extent these models remain aligned, even when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs. However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Performance Evaluation and Cyberattack Mitigation in a Blockchain-Enabled Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Framework""?","With the electric power grid experiencing a rapid shift to the smart grid paradigm over a deregulated energy market, Internet of Things (IoT)-based solutions are gaining prominence, and innovative peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading at a micro level is being deployed. Such advancement, however, leaves traditional security models vulnerable and paves the path for blockchain, a distributed ledger technology (DLT), with its decentralized, open, and transparency characteristics as a viable alternative. However, due to deregulation in energy trading markets, most of the prototype resilience regarding cybersecurity attack, performance and scalability of transaction broadcasting, and its direct impact on overall performances and attacks are required to be supported, which becomes a performance bottleneck with existing blockchain solutions such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, and so on. In this paper, we design a novel permissioned Corda framework for P2P energy trading peers that not only mitigates a new class of cyberattacks, i.e., delay trading (or discard), but also disseminates the transactions in a optimized propagation time, resulting in a fair transaction distribution. Sharing transactions in a permissioned R3 Corda blockchain framework is handled by the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and transport layer security (TLS). The unique contribution of this paper lies in the use of an optimized CPU and JVM heap memory scenario analysis with P2P metric in addition to a far more realistic multihosted testbed for the performance analysis. The average latencies measured are 22 ms and 51 ms for sending and receiving messages. We compare the throughput by varying different types of flow such as energy request, request + pay, transfer, multiple notary, sender, receiver, and single notary. In the proposed framework, request is an energy asset that is based on payment state and contract in the P2P energy trading module, so in request flow, only one node with no notary appears on the vault of the node.Energy request + pay flow interaction deals with two nodes, such as producer and consumer, to deal with request and transfer of asset ownership with the help of a notary. Request + repeated pay flow request, on node A and repeatedly transfers a fraction of energy asset state to another node, B, through a notary."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Assessing Language Model Deployment with Risk Cards""?","This paper introduces RiskCards, a framework for structured assessment and documentation of risks associated with an application of language models. As with all language, text generated by language models can be harmful, or used to bring about harm. Automating language generation adds both an element of scale and also more subtle or emergent undesirable tendencies to the generated text. Prior work establishes a wide variety of language model harms to many different actors: existing taxonomies identify categories of harms posed by language models; benchmarks establish automated tests of these harms; and documentation standards for models, tasks and datasets encourage transparent reporting. However, there is no risk-centric framework for documenting the complexity of a landscape in which some risks are shared across models and contexts, while others are specific, and where certain conditions may be required for risks to manifest as harms. RiskCards address this methodological gap by providing a generic framework for assessing the use of a given language model in a given scenario. Each RiskCard makes clear the routes for the risk to manifest harm, their placement in harm taxonomies, and example prompt-output pairs. While RiskCards are designed to be open-source, dynamic and participatory, we present a""starter set""of RiskCards taken from a broad literature survey, each of which details a concrete risk presentation. Language model RiskCards initiate a community knowledge base which permits the mapping of risks and harms to a specific model or its application scenario, ultimately contributing to a better, safer and shared understanding of the risk landscape."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Clusterin protects mature dendritic cells from reactive oxygen species mediated cell death""?","ABSTRACT Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the induction of the adaptive immune response. They capture antigens in peripheral tissues and prime naïve T lymphocytes, triggering the adaptive immune response. In the course of inflammatory processes DCs face stressful conditions including hypoxia, low pH and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), among others. How DCs survive under these adverse conditions remain poorly understood. Clusterin is a protein highly expressed by tumors and usually associated with bad prognosis. It promotes cancer cell survival by different mechanisms such as apoptosis inhibition and promotion of autophagy. Here, we show that, upon maturation, human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) up-regulate clusterin expression. Clusterin protects MoDCs from ROS-mediated toxicity, enhancing DC survival and promoting their ability to induce T cell activation. In line with these results, we found that clusterin is expressed by a population of mature LAMP3+ DCs, called mregDCs, but not by immature DCs in human cancer. The expression of clusterin by intratumoral DCs was shown to be associated with a transcriptomic profile indicative of cellular response to stress. These results uncover an important role for clusterin in DC physiology."

Despite recent advances, existing factuality evaluation models are not robust, being especially prone to entity and relation errors in new domains. We propose FactKB, a simple new approach to factuality evaluation that is generalizable across domains, in particular with respect to entities and relations. FactKB is based on language models pretrained using facts extracted from external knowledge bases. We introduce three types of complementary factuality pretraining objectives based on direct entity facts, facts grounded in auxiliary knowledge about entities, and facts constructed compositionally through knowledge base walks. The resulting factuality evaluation model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two in-domain news summarization benchmarks as well as on three out-of-domain scientific literature datasets. Further analysis of FactKB shows improved ability to detect erroneous entities and relations in summaries and is robust and generalizable across domains."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Pre-computed memory or on-the-fly encoding? A hybrid approach to retrieval augmentation makes the most of your compute""?","Retrieval-augmented language models such as Fusion-in-Decoder are powerful, setting the state of the art on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks. However, they are also expensive, due to the need to encode a large number of retrieved passages. Some work avoids this cost by pre-encoding a text corpus into a memory and retrieving dense representations directly. However, pre-encoding memory incurs a severe quality penalty as the memory representations are not conditioned on the current input. We propose LUMEN, a hybrid between these two extremes, pre-computing the majority of the retrieval representation and completing the encoding on the fly using a live encoder that is conditioned on the question and fine-tuned for the task. We show that LUMEN significantly outperforms pure memory on multiple question-answering tasks while being much cheaper than FiD, and outperforms both for any given compute budget. Moreover, the advantage of LUMEN over FiD increases with model size."

This paper focuses on the end-to-end (E2E) SLU model due to its small latency property, unlike a cascade system, and aims to minimize the computational cost. We reduce the model size by applying tensor decomposition to the Conformer and E-Branchformer architectures used in our E2E SLU models. We propose to apply singular value decomposition to linear layers and the Tucker decomposition to convolution layers, respectively. We also compare COMP/PARFAC decomposition and Tensor-Train decomposition to the Tucker decomposition. Since the E2E model is represented by a single neural network, our tensor decomposition can flexibly control the number of parameters without changing feature dimensions. On the STOP dataset, we achieved 70.9% exact match accuracy under the tight constraint of only 15 million parameters."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Fracture Risk in Men and Women With Vertebral Fractures Identified Opportunistically on Routine Computed Tomography Scans and Not Treated for Osteoporosis: An Observational Cohort Study""?","Vertebral fractures (VFs) have been associated with future fractures, yet few studies have evaluated whether this pertains to VFs available for identification on routine radiological imaging. We sought to evaluate the risk of subsequent fractures in subjects with VF identified opportunistically on computed tomography (CT) scans performed as part of routine clinical practice. From the radiology database of Holbæk Hospital we identified the first CT scan including the thorax and/or abdomen of 2000 consecutive men and women aged 50 years or older, performed from January 1, 2010 onward. The scans were assessed in a blinded approach to identify chest and lumbar VF, and these data linked to national Danish registers. Subjects were excluded if treated with an osteoporosis medication (OM) in the year prior to baseline (date of CT), and the remaining subjects with VF matched on age and sex in 1:2 ratio against subjects with no VF. We found that the risk of major osteoporotic fractures (hip, non‐cervical vertebral, humerus, and distal forearm fractures) was higher for subjects with VF than without VF: incidence rates (IRs) were 32.88 and 19.59 fractures per 1000 subject‐years, respectively, and the adjusted hazard ratio (HRadj) was 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–2.86). Subsequent hip fracture IRs were 16.75 and 6.60; HRadj 3.02 (95% CI, 1.39–6.55). There were no significant differences in other fracture outcomes (including a pooled estimate of any subsequent fracture, except face, skull, and fingers: IRs 41.52 and 31.38; HRadj 1.31 [95% CI, 0.85–2.03]). Our findings suggest that subjects undergoing routine CT scans including the chest and/or abdomen are a high risk population in terms of fracture risk. Even within this group, subjects with VF are at higher risk of future major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), in particular hip fracture. Hence, systematic opportunistic screening for VF and subsequent fracture risk management is important to reduce the risk of new fractures. © 2023 The Authors.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Hierarchical Event Grounding""?","Event grounding aims at linking mention references in text corpora to events from a knowledge base (KB). Previous work on this task focused primarily on linking to a single KB event, thereby overlooking the hierarchical aspects of events. Events in documents are typically described at various levels of spatio-temporal granularity. These hierarchical relations are utilized in downstream tasks of narrative understanding and schema construction. In this work, we present an extension to the event grounding task that requires tackling hierarchical event structures from the KB. Our proposed task involves linking a mention reference to a set of event labels from a subevent hierarchy in the KB. We propose a retrieval methodology that leverages event hierarchy through an auxiliary hierarchical loss. On an automatically created multilingual dataset from Wikipedia and Wikidata, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical loss against retrieve and re-rank baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the systems' ability to aid hierarchical discovery among unseen events. Code is available at https://github.com/JefferyO/Hierarchical-Event-Grounding"

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Image–text coherence and its implications for multimodal AI""?","Human communication often combines imagery and text into integrated presentations, especially online. In this paper, we show how image–text coherence relations can be used to model the pragmatics of image–text presentations in AI systems. In contrast to alternative frameworks that characterize image–text presentations in terms of the priority, relevance, or overlap of information across modalities, coherence theory postulates that each unit of a discourse stands in specific pragmatic relations to other parts of the discourse, with each relation involving its own information goals and inferential connections. Text accompanying an image may, for example, characterize what's visible in the image, explain how the image was obtained, offer the author's appraisal of or reaction to the depicted situation, and so forth. The advantage of coherence theory is that it provides a simple, robust, and effective abstraction of communicative goals for practical applications. To argue this, we review case studies describing coherence in image–text data sets, predicting coherence from few-shot annotations, and coherence models of image–text tasks such as caption generation and caption evaluation."

By exploiting the spatial multiplexing ability of the photopolymer and the transmission channel selection capability of the scattering medium, we have realized a dynamic holographic display of 3D spirals consisting of 20 foci across 1 millimeter × 1 millimeter × 26 millimeters with uniform intensity."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Inference of single cell profiles from histology stains with the Single-Cell omics from Histology Analysis Framework (SCHAF)""?","Tissue biology involves an intricate balance between cell-intrinsic processes and interactions between cells organized in specific spatial patterns, which can be respectively captured by single-cell profiling methods, such as single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and histology imaging data, such as Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) stains. While single-cell profiles provide rich molecular information, they can be challenging to collect routinely and do not have spatial resolution. Conversely, histological H&E assays have been a cornerstone of tissue pathology for decades, but do not directly report on molecular details, although the observed structure they capture arises from molecules and cells. Here, we leverage adversarial machine learning to develop SCHAF (Single-Cell omics from Histology Analysis Framework), to generate a tissue sample’s spatially-resolved single-cell omics dataset from its H&E histology image. We demonstrate SCHAF on two types of human tumors—from lung and metastatic breast cancer—training with matched samples analyzed by both sc/snRNA-seq and by H&E staining. SCHAF generated appropriate single-cell profiles from histology images in test data, related them spatially, and compared well to ground-truth scRNA-Seq, expert pathologist annotations, or direct MERFISH measurements. SCHAF opens the way to next-generation H&E2.0 analyses and an integrated understanding of cell and tissue biology in health and disease."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning""?","Recent text-to-image generation models like DreamBooth have made remarkable progress in generating highly customized images of a target subject, by fine-tuning an ``expert model'' for a given subject from a few examples. However, this process is expensive, since a new expert model must be learned for each subject. In this paper, we present SuTI, a Subject-driven Text-to-Image generator that replaces subject-specific fine tuning with in-context learning. Given a few demonstrations of a new subject, SuTI can instantly generate novel renditions of the subject in different scenes, without any subject-specific optimization. SuTI is powered by apprenticeship learning, where a single apprentice model is learned from data generated by a massive number of subject-specific expert models. Specifically, we mine millions of image clusters from the Internet, each centered around a specific visual subject. We adopt these clusters to train a massive number of expert models, each specializing in a different subject. The apprentice model SuTI then learns to imitate the behavior of these fine-tuned experts. SuTI can generate high-quality and customized subject-specific images 20x faster than optimization-based SoTA methods. On the challenging DreamBench and DreamBench-v2, our human evaluation shows that SuTI significantly outperforms existing models like InstructPix2Pix, Textual Inversion, Imagic, Prompt2Prompt, Re-Imagen and DreamBooth, especially on the subject and text alignment aspects."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Neuropilin-1 interacts with VE-cadherin and TGFBR2 to stabilize adherens junctions and prevent activation of endothelium under flow""?","Linear and disturbed flow differentially regulate gene expression, with disturbed flow priming endothelial cells (ECs) for a proinflammatory, atheroprone expression profile and phenotype. Here, we investigated the role of the transmembrane protein neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in ECs exposed to flow using cultured ECs, mice with an endothelium-specific knockout of NRP1, and a mouse model of atherosclerosis. We demonstrated that NRP1 was a constituent of adherens junctions that interacted with VE-cadherin and promoted its association with p120 catenin, stabilizing adherens junctions and inducing cytoskeletal remodeling in alignment with the direction of flow. We also showed that NRP1 interacted with transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptor II (TGFBR2) and reduced the plasma membrane localization of TGFBR2 and TGF-β signaling. NRP1 knockdown increased the abundance of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, resulting in increased leukocyte rolling and atherosclerotic plaque size. These findings describe a role for NRP1 in promoting endothelial function and reveal a mechanism by which NRP1 reduction in ECs may contribute to vascular disease by modulating adherens junction signaling and promoting TGF-β signaling and inflammation. Description The barrier function and quiescence of the endothelium are supported by transmembrane protein NRP1. Maintaining a quiescent endothelium Atherosclerosis causes disturbed blood flow that activates inflammatory pathways in endothelial cells, which attracts leukocytes to plaques and exacerbates disease progression. Bosseboeuf et al. investigated the role of the transmembrane protein NRP1 in the response of the endothelium to flow. Under normal flow patterns, NRP1 stabilized protein complexes at cell-cell junctions called adherens junctions and suppressed endothelial inflammation. In mice, NRP1 deficiency was associated with greater numbers of rolling leukocytes on endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo and larger plaque sizes in a model of atherosclerosis. Thus, NRP1 maintains the endothelium in a quiescent state and may limit inflammation in the endothelium under the disturbed blood flow patterns that are characteristic of atherosclerosis. —WW"

The model uses a hierarchical transformer with intra-frame off-set attention and inter-frame self-attention. The attention mechanism allows the model to freely attend between any two vertex patches to learn nonlocal relationships in the spatial-temporal domain. Masked vertex modeling and future frame prediction are used as two self-supervised tasks to fully activate the bi-directional and auto-regressive attention in our hierarchical transformer. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to skeleton-based and point-cloud-based models on common MoCap benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/zgzxy001/STMT."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""MRI Features for Predicting Microvascular Invasion and Postoperative Recurrence in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Without Peritumoral Hypointensity""?","Purpose To identify MRI features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that predict microvascular invasion (MVI) and postoperative intrahepatic recurrence in patients without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointensity. Patients and Methods One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was analyzed. We then assessed the MRI features of HCC that predicted the MVI and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the subgroup without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Finally, a two-step flowchart was constructed to assist in clinical decision-making. Results Peritumoral HBP hypointensity (odds ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval: 1.071–8.512; P=0.037) was an independent predictor of MVI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUROC of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in predicting MVI were 23.80%, 91.04%, 71.23%, 55.96%, and 0.574, respectively. Intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity (P<0.001). In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the only significant difference between MVI-positive and MVI-negative HCCs was the presence of a radiological capsule (P=0.038). Satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS (hazard ratio,3.324; 95% CI: 1.733–6.378; P<0.001). The high-risk HCC detection rate was significantly higher when using the two-step flowchart that incorporated peritumoral HBP hypointensity and satellite nodule than when using peritumoral HBP hypointensity alone (P<0.001). Conclusion In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, a radiological capsule is useful for identifying MVI and satellite nodule is an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS."

Proton and helium are the first-and second-most abundant components in cosmic rays. Given their smaller interaction cross sections with the interstellar medium, compared to heavier nuclei, they can travel larger distances, thereby becoming important probes to cosmic-ray sources as well as acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Recently, in the DAMPE collaboration, machine learning (ML) techniques were developed and deployed to improve particle tracking and identification and correct for the calorimeter readout saturation at high energies. This work presents a direct measurement of the energy spectra of cosmic-ray protons and helium nuclei, using 84 and 81 months of data, respectively, recorded by DAMPE. Application of the above-mentioned ML techniques helps in extending the spectra to higher kinetic energies than those previously reported by DAMPE"

However, automatic control of magnetic guidewires (MGs) is still challenging in terms of modeling of guidewires and trajectory planning. Herein, a magnetically controlled guidewire robotic system (MCGRS) with steering and propulsion capabilities is proposed based on adequate modeling and trajectory planning methods. The steering kinematics of MG is first modeled by constant curvature theory. Then, a continuum mechanics model is built to predict the deformation of the magnetic tip by combining the dipole model and the Cosserat‐rod model. Moreover, a trajectory planning algorithm is developed to navigate the MG through vessels. Furthermore, trajectory following experiments within three vascular phantoms confirm that the proposed model and algorithm are reliable and capable of navigating the MG through the desired trajectory. Finally, two extra navigation experiments are implemented in 3D vascular phantom, which show that the MCGRS can be remotely controlled to manipulate the MG to actively steer and reach the target site. The system and methods will build the foundation for automatic control of MG and help to improve the autonomy."

Model compression techniques such as pruning aim to reduce the model size and computation without degradation in accuracy. Prior studies focus on the pruning of Transformers; however, speech models not only utilize a stack of Transformer blocks, but also combine a frontend network based on multiple convolutional layers for low-level feature representation learning. This frontend has a small size but a heavy computational cost. In this work, we propose three task-specific structured pruning methods to deal with such heterogeneous networks. Experiments on LibriSpeech and SLURP show that the proposed method is more accurate than the original wav2vec2-base with 10% to 30% less computation, and is able to reduce the computation by 40% to 50% without any degradation."

We propose WavLabLM, which extends WavLM’s joint prediction and denoising to 40k hours of data across 136 languages. To build WavLabLM, we devise a novel multi-stage pre-training method, designed to address the language imbalance of multilingual data. WavLabLM achieves comparable performance to XLS-R on ML-SUPERB with less than $10 \%$ of the training data, making SSL realizable with academic compute. We show that further efficiency can be achieved with a vanilla HuBERT Base model, which can maintain $94 \%$ of XLS-R’s performance with only $3 \%$ of the data, 4 GPUs, and limited trials.

Applying these methods for low-resource languages can be problematic since there is no single large answer source for these languages. Consequently, this can result in a high ratio of unanswered questions, since the amount of information in any single source is limited. To address this problem, we developed a novel crowd-sourcing platform to gather multiple-domain QA data for low-resource languages. Our platform, which consists of a mobile app and a web API, gamifies the data collection process. We successfully released the app for Icelandic (a low-resource language with about 350,000 native speakers) to build a dataset which rivals large QA datasets for high-resource languages both in terms of size and ratio of answered questions.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Lactobacillus johnsonii (L. johnsonii) in a rat model of PNALD. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-fed rats were used to assess the role of L. johnsonii in liver steatosis, bile acid metabolism, gut microbiota, and hepatocyte apoptosis. We observed a depletion of L. johnsonii that was negatively correlated with the accumulation of glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), a known apoptosis inducer, in rats subjected to TPN. L. johnsonii attenuated TPN-induced liver steatosis by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and promoting fatty acid oxidation. TPN resulted in a decrease in bile acid synthesis and biliary bile secretion, which were partially restored by L. johnsonii treatment.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Modeling Empathic Similarity in Personal Narratives""?","The most meaningful connections between people are often fostered through expression of shared vulnerability and emotional experiences in personal narratives. We introduce a new task of identifying similarity in personal stories based on empathic resonance, i.e., the extent to which two people empathize with each others' experiences, as opposed to raw semantic or lexical similarity, as has predominantly been studied in NLP. Using insights from social psychology, we craft a framework that operationalizes empathic similarity in terms of three key features of stories: main events, emotional trajectories, and overall morals or takeaways. We create EmpathicStories, a dataset of 1,500 personal stories annotated with our empathic similarity features, and 2,000 pairs of stories annotated with empathic similarity scores. Using our dataset, we fine-tune a model to compute empathic similarity of story pairs, and show that this outperforms semantic similarity models on automated correlation and retrieval metrics. Through a user study with 150 participants, we also assess the effect our model has on retrieving stories that users empathize with, compared to naive semantic similarity-based retrieval, and find that participants empathized significantly more with stories retrieved by our model. Our work has strong implications for the use of empathy-aware models to foster human connection and empathy between people."

While recent advances have enabled intelligible articulatory synthesis using electromagnetic articulography (EMA), these methods lack critical articulatory information like excitation and nasality, limiting generalization capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose an alternative MRI-based feature set that covers a much more extensive articulatory space than EMA. We also introduce normalization and denoising procedures to enhance the generalizability of deep learning methods trained on MRI data. Moreover, we propose an MRI-to-speech model that improves both computational efficiency and speech fidelity.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Learning Performance-Improving Code Edits""?","The waning of Moore's Law has shifted the focus of the tech industry towards alternative methods for continued performance gains. While optimizing compilers are a standard tool to help increase program efficiency, programmers continue to shoulder much responsibility in crafting and refactoring code with better performance characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to suggest functionally correct, performance improving code edits. We hypothesize that language models can suggest such edits in ways that would be impractical for static analysis alone. We investigate these questions by curating a large-scale dataset of Performance-Improving Edits, PIE. PIE contains trajectories of programs, where a programmer begins with an initial, slower version and iteratively makes changes to improve the program's performance. We use PIE to evaluate and improve the capacity of large language models. Specifically, use examples from PIE to fine-tune multiple variants of CODEGEN, a billion-scale Transformer-decoder model. Additionally, we use examples from PIE to prompt OpenAI's CODEX using a few-shot prompting. By leveraging PIE, we find that both CODEX and CODEGEN can generate performance-improving edits, with speedups of more than 2.5x for over 25% of the programs, for C++ and Python, even after the C++ programs were compiled using the O3 optimization level. Crucially, we show that PIE allows CODEGEN, an open-sourced and 10x smaller model than CODEX, to match the performance of CODEX on this challenging task. Overall, this work opens new doors for creating systems and methods that can help programmers write efficient code."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Imprecise Label Learning: A Unified Framework for Learning with Various Imprecise Label Configurations""?","Learning with reduced labeling standards, such as noisy label, partial label, and multiple label candidates, which we generically refer to as \textit{imprecise} labels, is a commonplace challenge in machine learning tasks. Previous methods tend to propose specific designs for every emerging imprecise label configuration, which is usually unsustainable when multiple configurations of imprecision coexist. In this paper, we introduce imprecise label learning (ILL), a framework for the unification of learning with various imprecise label configurations. ILL leverages expectation-maximization (EM) for modeling the imprecise label information, treating the precise labels as latent variables.Instead of approximating the correct labels for training, it considers the entire distribution of all possible labeling entailed by the imprecise information. We demonstrate that ILL can seamlessly adapt to partial label learning, semi-supervised learning, noisy label learning, and, more importantly, a mixture of these settings. Notably, ILL surpasses the existing specified techniques for handling imprecise labels, marking the first unified framework with robust and effective performance across various challenging settings. We hope our work will inspire further research on this topic, unleashing the full potential of ILL in wider scenarios where precise labels are expensive and complicated to obtain."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Crosstalk of Inflammatory Cytokines within the Breast Tumor Microenvironment""?","Several immune and immunocompetent cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages, adipocytes, natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells, are significantly correlated with the complex discipline of oncology. Cytotoxic innate and adaptive immune cells can block tumor proliferation, and others can prevent the immune system from rejecting malignant cells and provide a favorable environment for tumor progression. These cells communicate with the microenvironment through cytokines, a chemical messenger, in an endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine manner. These cytokines play an important role in health and disease, particularly in host immune responses to infection and inflammation. They include chemokines, interleukins (ILs), adipokines, interferons, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which are produced by a wide range of cells, including immune cells, such as macrophages, B-cells, T-cells, and mast cells, as well as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, a variety of stromal cells, and some cancer cells. Cytokines play a crucial role in cancer and cancer-related inflammation, with direct and indirect effects on tumor antagonistic or tumor promoting functions. They have been extensively researched as immunostimulatory mediators to promote the generation, migration and recruitment of immune cells that contribute to an effective antitumor immune response or pro-tumor microenvironment. Thus, in many cancers such as breast cancer, cytokines including leptin, IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8, IL-23, IL-17, and IL-10 stimulate while others including IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-γ, inhibit cancer proliferation and/or invasion and enhance the body’s anti-tumor defense. Indeed, the multifactorial functions of cytokines in tumorigenesis will advance our understanding of cytokine crosstalk pathways in the tumor microenvironment, such as JAK/STAT, PI3K, AKT, Rac, MAPK, NF-κB, JunB, cFos, and mTOR, which are involved in angiogenesis, cancer proliferation and metastasis. Accordingly, targeting and blocking tumor-promoting cytokines or activating and amplifying tumor-inhibiting cytokines are considered cancer-directed therapies. Here, we focus on the role of the inflammatory cytokine system in pro- and anti-tumor immune responses, discuss cytokine pathways involved in immune responses to cancer and some anti-cancer therapeutic applications."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Emerging Therapeutic Approaches to Target the Dark Side of Senescent Cells: New Hopes to Treat Aging as a Disease and to Delay Age-Related Pathologies""?","Life expectancy has drastically increased over the last few decades worldwide, with important social and medical burdens and costs. To stay healthy longer and to avoid chronic disease have become essential issues. Organismal aging is a complex process that involves progressive destruction of tissue functionality and loss of regenerative capacity. One of the most important aging hallmarks is cellular senescence, which is a stable state of cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to cumulated cell stresses and damages. Cellular senescence is a physiological mechanism that has both beneficial and detrimental consequences. Senescence limits tumorigenesis, lifelong tissue damage, and is involved in different biological processes, such as morphogenesis, regeneration, and wound healing. However, in the elderly, senescent cells increasingly accumulate in several organs and secrete a combination of senescence associated factors, contributing to the development of various age-related diseases, including cancer. Several studies have revealed major molecular pathways controlling the senescent phenotype, as well as the ones regulating its interactions with the immune system. Attenuating the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) or eliminating senescent cells have emerged as attractive strategies aiming to reverse or delay the onset of aging diseases. Here, we review current senotherapies designed to suppress the deleterious effect of SASP by senomorphics or to selectively kill senescent cells by “senolytics” or by immune system-based approaches. These recent investigations are promising as radical new controls of aging pathologies and associated multimorbidities."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""D-CALM: A Dynamic Clustering-based Active Learning Approach for Mitigating Bias""?","Despite recent advancements, NLP models continue to be vulnerable to bias. This bias often originates from the uneven distribution of real-world data and can propagate through the annotation process. Escalated integration of these models in our lives calls for methods to mitigate bias without overbearing annotation costs. While active learning (AL) has shown promise in training models with a small amount of annotated data, AL's reliance on the model's behavior for selective sampling can lead to an accumulation of unwanted bias rather than bias mitigation. However, infusing clustering with AL can overcome the bias issue of both AL and traditional annotation methods while exploiting AL's annotation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive clustering-based active learning algorithm, D-CALM, that dynamically adjusts clustering and annotation efforts in response to an estimated classifier error-rate. Experiments on eight datasets for a diverse set of text classification tasks, including emotion, hatespeech, dialog act, and book type detection, demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline AL approaches with both pretrained transformers and traditional Support Vector Machines. D-CALM showcases robustness against different measures of information gain and, as evident from our analysis of label and error distribution, can significantly reduce unwanted model bias."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation""?","During phonation, the vocal folds exhibit a self-sustained oscillatory motion, which is influenced by the physical properties of the speaker’s vocal folds and driven by the balance of bio-mechanical and aerodynamic forces across the glottis. Subtle changes in the speaker’s physical state can affect voice production and alter these oscillatory patterns. Measuring these can be valuable in developing computational tools that analyze voice to infer the speaker’s state. Traditionally, vocal fold oscillations (VFOs) are measured directly using physical devices in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a novel analysis-by-synthesis approach that allows us to infer the VFOs directly from recorded speech signals on an individualized, speaker-by-speaker basis. The approach, called the ADLES-VFT algorithm, is proposed in the context of a joint model that combines a phonation model (with a glottal flow waveform as the output) and a vocal tract acoustic wave propagation model such that the output of the joint model is an estimated waveform. The ADLES-VFT algorithm is a forward-backward algorithm which minimizes the error between the recorded waveform and the output of this joint model to estimate its parameters. Once estimated, these parameter values are used in conjunction with a phonation model to obtain its solutions. Since the parameters correlate with the physical properties of the vocal folds of the speaker, model solutions obtained using them represent the individualized VFOs for each speaker. The approach is flexible and can be applied to various phonation models. In addition to presenting the methodology, we show how the VFOs can be quantified from a dynamical systems perspective for classification purposes. Mathematical derivations are provided in an appendix for better readability."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Universal Source Separation with Weakly Labelled Data""?","Universal source separation (USS) is a fundamental research task for computational auditory scene analysis, which aims to separate mono recordings into individual source tracks. There are three potential challenges awaiting the solution to the audio source separation task. First, previous audio source separation systems mainly focus on separating one or a limited number of specific sources. There is a lack of research on building a unified system that can separate arbitrary sources via a single model. Second, most previous systems require clean source data to train a separator, while clean source data are scarce. Third, there is a lack of USS system that can automatically detect and separate active sound classes in a hierarchical level. To use large-scale weakly labeled/unlabeled audio data for audio source separation, we propose a universal audio source separation framework containing: 1) an audio tagging model trained on weakly labeled data as a query net; and 2) a conditional source separation model that takes query net outputs as conditions to separate arbitrary sound sources. We investigate various query nets, source separation models, and training strategies and propose a hierarchical USS strategy to automatically detect and separate sound classes from the AudioSet ontology. By solely leveraging the weakly labelled AudioSet, our USS system is successful in separating a wide variety of sound classes, including sound event separation, music source separation, and speech enhancement. The USS system achieves an average signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (SDRi) of 5.57 dB over 527 sound classes of AudioSet; 10.57 dB on the DCASE 2018 Task 2 dataset; 8.12 dB on the MUSDB18 dataset; an SDRi of 7.28 dB on the Slakh2100 dataset; and an SSNR of 9.00 dB on the voicebank-demand dataset.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Multimodal Learning Without Labeled Multimodal Data: Guarantees and Applications""?","In many machine learning systems that jointly learn from multiple modalities, a core research question is to understand the nature of multimodal interactions: the emergence of new task-relevant information during learning from both modalities that was not present in either alone. We study this challenge of interaction quantification in a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data (e.g., unlabeled images and captions, video and corresponding audio) but when labeling them is time-consuming. Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, our key contributions are the derivations of lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting. We propose two lower bounds based on the amount of shared information between modalities and the disagreement between separately trained unimodal classifiers, and derive an upper bound through connections to approximate algorithms for min-entropy couplings. We validate these estimated bounds and show how they accurately track true interactions. Finally, two semi-supervised multimodal applications are explored based on these theoretical results: (1) analyzing the relationship between multimodal performance and estimated interactions, and (2) self-supervised learning that embraces disagreement between modalities beyond agreement as is typically done."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Assessment of the activity of secondary caries lesions with short-wavelength infrared, thermal, and optical coherence tomographic imaging""?","Abstract. Significance: Leakage in the interfaces between restorative materials and tooth structure allows for fluid and bacterial acid infiltration, causing restoration failure due to secondary caries. Dentists spend more time replacing composite restorations than placing new ones. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies on enamel and root surfaces using shortwave-infrared (SWIR) and thermal imaging during dehydration with forced air have been promising for assessing lesion activity. Aim: We hypothesized that SWIR reflectance and thermal imaging methods can be used to monitor the activity of secondary caries lesions around composite restorations. The objective of this study was to employ these methods to measure the rate of fluid loss from lesions during dehydration with forced air to assess lesion activity. Approach: Sixty-three extracted human teeth with total of 109 suspected secondary lesions were examined using SWIR and thermal imaging during dehydration. The thickness of the highly mineralized transparent surface layer (TSL) at lesion interfaces indicative of lesion activity was measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Micro-computed tomography (MicroCT) was used to further confirm lesion severity and structure. OCT and MicroCT measurements of lesion structure, depth, and severity were correlated with fluid loss rates measured with SWIR reflectance and thermal imaging. Results: TSL thickness measured with OCT correlated with both SWIR reflectance and thermal measurements of rates of fluid loss (p  <  0.05). Increasing TSL thickness led to decreased permeability of lesions, potentially indicating full lesion arrest at TSL  ≥  70  μm. SWIR performed better than thermal imaging for secondary lesion activity assessment, although both methods performed best on smooth surface lesions. Conclusions: Nondestructive SWIR reflectance and OCT imaging methods are promising for clinically monitoring the activity of secondary caries lesions."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""The Hidden Dance of Phonemes and Visage: Unveiling the Enigmatic Link between Phonemes and Facial Features""?","This work unveils the enigmatic link between phonemes and facial features. Traditional studies on voice-face correlations typically involve using a long period of voice input, including generating face images from voices and reconstructing 3D face meshes from voices. However, in situations like voice-based crimes, the available voice evidence may be short and limited. Additionally, from a physiological perspective, each segment of speech -- phoneme -- corresponds to different types of airflow and movements in the face. Therefore, it is advantageous to discover the hidden link between phonemes and face attributes. In this paper, we propose an analysis pipeline to help us explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.e., phonemes v.s. facial anthropometric measurements (AM). We build an estimator for each phoneme-AM pair and evaluate the correlation through hypothesis testing. Our results indicate that AMs are more predictable from vowels compared to consonants, particularly with plosives. Additionally, we observe that if a specific AM exhibits more movement during phoneme pronunciation, it is more predictable. Our findings support those in physiology regarding correlation and lay the groundwork for future research on speech-face multimodal learning."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""NLPositionality: Characterizing Design Biases of Datasets and Models""?","Design biases in NLP systems, such as performance differences for different populations, often stem from their creator’s positionality, i.e., views and lived experiences shaped by identity and background. Despite the prevalence and risks of design biases, they are hard to quantify because researcher, system, and dataset positionality is often unobserved. We introduce NLPositionality, a framework for characterizing design biases and quantifying the positionality of NLP datasets and models. Our framework continuously collects annotations from a diverse pool of volunteer participants on LabintheWild, and statistically quantifies alignment with dataset labels and model predictions. We apply NLPositionality to existing datasets and models for two tasks—social acceptability and hate speech detection. To date, we have collected 16,299 annotations in over a year for 600 instances from 1,096 annotators across 87 countries.We find that datasets and models align predominantly with Western, White, college-educated, and younger populations. Additionally, certain groups, such as non-binary people and non-native English speakers, are further marginalized by datasets and models as they rank least in alignment across all tasks. Finally, we draw from prior literature to discuss how researchers can examine their own positionality and that of their datasets and models, opening the door for more inclusive NLP systems."

Thirty-two subjects (n = 597 teeth) were enrolled in this longitudinal observational clinical study. Enamel thickness (by cross-polarization optical coherence tomography, CP-OCT) and 3D dental microwear parameters, i.e., area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc), anisotropy (Str), and roughness (Sa) (by white-light scanning confocal profilometry), were obtained from buccal surfaces. Buccal, occlusal, and lingual surfaces were scored for BEWE and the maximum score per tooth (BEWEMax) was determined at baseline and 12 months (M12). Data outcome relationships were evaluated (alpha = 0.05). Enamel thickness decreased (p < 0.001), BEWE scores, Sa, and Str increased (p < 0.001), while Asfc did not change at M12. Baseline BEWEBuccal correlated strongly with BEWEMax (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) and moderately with BEWELingual (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), but not with enamel thickness (r = 0.03, p = 0.43). Change (Δ) in surface texture outcomes correlated poorly but significantly with ΔBEWEBuccal (r = −0.15–0.16, p < 0.001) and did not correlate with Δenamel thickness (r = 0.02–0.09, p > 0.06). Teeth with BEWE progression revealed a greater increase in ΔSa and ΔStr. These findings suggest that enamel surface roughness can potentially determine ETW severity, and CP-OCT may be relevant for clinically monitoring enamel thickness."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Exploring Fundamental Particle Acceleration and Loss Processes in Heliophysics through an Orbiting X-ray Instrument in the Jovian System""?","Jupiter's magnetosphere is considered to be the most powerful particle accelerator in the Solar System, accelerating electrons from eV to 70 MeV and ions to GeV energies. How electromagnetic processes drive energy and particle flows, producing and removing energetic particles, is at the heart of Heliophysics. Particularly, the 2013 Decadal Strategy for Solar and Space Physics was to""Discover and characterize fundamental processes that occur both within the heliosphere and throughout the universe"". The Jovian system offers an ideal natural laboratory to investigate all of the universal processes highlighted in the previous Decadal. The X-ray waveband has been widely used to remotely study plasma across astrophysical systems. The majority of astrophysical emissions can be grouped into 5 X-ray processes: fluorescence, thermal/coronal, scattering, charge exchange and particle acceleration. The Jovian system offers perhaps the only system that presents a rich catalog of all of these X-ray emission processes and can also be visited in-situ, affording the special possibility to directly link fundamental plasma processes with their resulting X-ray signatures. This offers invaluable ground-truths for astrophysical objects beyond the reach of in-situ exploration (e.g. brown dwarfs, magnetars or galaxy clusters that map the cosmos). Here, we show how coupling in-situ measurements with in-orbit X-ray observations of Jupiter's radiation belts, Galilean satellites, Io Torus, and atmosphere addresses fundamental heliophysics questions with wide-reaching impact across helio- and astrophysics. New developments like miniaturized X-ray optics and radiation-tolerant detectors, provide compact, lightweight, wide-field X-ray instruments perfectly suited to the Jupiter system, enabling this exciting new possibility."

The goal is for participants to devise a single system that can generalize across different array geometries and use cases with no a-priori information. Another departure from earlier CHiME iterations is that participants are allowed to use open-source pre-trained models and datasets. In this paper, we describe the challenge design, motivation, and fundamental research questions in detail.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Transcriptional Misexpression in Hybrids between Species Linked by Gene Flow Is Associated With Patterns of Sequence Divergence""?","Abstract The extent to which hybridization disrupts a gene's pattern of expression likely governs its propensity for introgression, whereas its extent of molecular divergence can itself underlie such disruption. Together, these phenomena shape the landscape of sequence and transcriptional divergence across the genome as species diverge. To understand this process, we characterize gene expression inheritance, regulatory divergence, and molecular divergence in the reproductive transcriptomes of species linked by gene flow: the fruit flies Anastrepha fraterculus and A. obliqua, which show evidence of gene flow despite clear evolutionary divergence. We find that their transcriptional patterns are a mosaic between those typically observed within and between allopatric species. Transcripts showing transgressive expression in hybrids or cis-regulatory divergence between species are associated with greater sequence divergence. This may reflect pleiotropic constraints that make them resistant to gene flow or they may be more likely to experience divergent selection. Although these more divergent gene classes are likely to be important contributors to species differences, they are relatively rare. Instead, most differentially regulated transcripts, including those linked to reproduction, show high degrees of dominance in hybrids and trans-regulated divergence between species, suggesting widespread genetic compatibility that potentially allowed for introgression. These findings provide insights into how postzygotic isolating mechanisms might evolve in the presence of gene flow: regions showing cis-regulatory divergence or transgressive expression contribute to reproductive isolation, whereas regions with dominant expression and trans-regulatory divergence allow for introgression. These patterns create a genomic mosaic of transcriptional regulation that is tied to sequence divergence."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Comparison of freeze-thaw and sonication cycle-based methods for extracting AMR-associated metabolites from Staphylococcus aureus""?","Emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Gram-positive pathogens, specifically in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), is becoming a leading public health concern demanding effective therapeutics. Metabolite modulation can improve the efficacy of existing antibiotics and facilitate the development of effective therapeutics. However, it remained unexplored for drug-resistant S. aureus (gentamicin and methicillin-resistant), primarily due to the dearth of optimal metabolite extraction protocols including a protocol for AMR-associated metabolites. Therefore, in this investigation, we have compared the performance of the two most widely used methods, i.e., freeze-thaw cycle (FTC) and sonication cycle (SC), alone and in combination (FTC + SC), and identified the optimal method for this purpose. A total of 116, 119, and 99 metabolites were identified using the FTC, SC, and FTC + SC methods, respectively, leading to the identification of 163 metabolites cumulatively. Out of 163, 69 metabolites were found to be associated with AMR in published literature consisting of the highest number of metabolites identified by FTC (57) followed by SC (54) and FTC + SC (40). Thus, the performances of FTC and SC methods were comparable with no additional benefits of combining both. Moreover, each method showed biasness toward specific metabolite(s) or class of metabolites, suggesting that the choice of metabolite extraction method shall be decided based on the metabolites of interest in the investigation."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Unlimiformer: Long-Range Transformers with Unlimited Length Input""?","Since the proposal of transformers, these models have been limited to bounded input lengths, because of their need to attend to every token in the input. In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time; this way, we can index practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization benchmarks, showing that it can process even 500k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time. We demonstrate that Unlimiformer improves pretrained models such as BART and Longformer by extending them to unlimited inputs without additional learned weights and without modifying their code.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""CodeBERTScore: Evaluating Code Generation with Pretrained Models of Code""?","Since the rise of neural natural-language-to-code models (NL->Code) that can generate long expressions and statements rather than a single next-token, one of the major problems has been reliably evaluating their generated output. In this paper, we propose CodeBERTScore: an evaluation metric for code generation, which builds on BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020). Instead of encoding only the generated tokens as in BERTScore, CodeBERTScore also encodes the natural language input preceding the generated code, thus modeling the consistency between the generated code and its given natural language context as well. We perform an extensive evaluation of CodeBERTScore across four programming languages. We find that CodeBERTScore achieves a higher correlation with human preference and with functional correctness than all existing metrics. That is, generated code that receives a higher score by CodeBERTScore is more likely to be preferred by humans, as well as to function correctly when executed. We release five language-specific pretrained models to use with our publicly available code. Our language-specific models have been downloaded more than 1,000,000 times from the Huggingface Hub.

In this paper, we introduce imprecise label learning (ILL), a framework for the unification of learning with various imprecise label configurations. ILL leverages expectation-maximization (EM) for modeling the imprecise label information, treating the precise labels as latent variables.Instead of approximating the correct labels for training, it considers the entire distribution of all possible labeling entailed by the imprecise information. We demonstrate that ILL can seamlessly adapt to partial label learning, semi-supervised learning, noisy label learning, and, more importantly, a mixture of these settings. Notably, ILL surpasses the existing specified techniques for handling imprecise labels, marking the first unified framework with robust and effective performance across various challenging settings. We hope our work will inspire further research on this topic, unleashing the full potential of ILL in wider scenarios where precise labels are expensive and complicated to obtain."

The function of P53 and the relevant mechanisms of anti-neoplasm have raised the interest of researchers since many years ago. It is demonstrated that P53 is a basic cell cycle regulator and a strong inhibitor for versatile cancers in humans. However, most research focuses on other organs and systems instead of the central nervous system (CNS). In fact, in recent years, more and more studies have been suggesting that P53 plays a significant role in multiple CNS tumors and other diseases and disorders such as cerebral stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we mainly reviewed the P53’s relationship with CNS tumors, cerebral stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, together with the relevant mechanisms, aiming to summarize the research achievements and providing new insight to the future study on diseases in CNS."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""MultiViz: Towards User-Centric Visualizations and Interpretations of Multimodal Models""?","The nature of human and computer interactions are inherently multimodal, which has led to substantial interest in building interpretable, interactive, and reliable multimodal interfaces. However, modern multimodal models and interfaces are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it challenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize their internal workings in order to empower stakeholders to visualize model behavior, perform model debugging, and promote trust in these models? Our paper proposes MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of multimodal models via 4 stages: (1) unimodal importance, (2) cross-modal interactions, (3) multimodal representations and (4) multimodal prediction. MultiViz includes modular visualization tools for each stage before combining outputs from all stages through an interactive and human-in-the-loop API. Through user studies with 21 participants on 8 trained models across 6 real-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together enable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable concepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications, and (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models. MultiViz is publicly available at https://github.com/pliang279/MultiViz, will be regularly updated with new visualization tools and metrics, and welcomes input from the community1."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Examining risks of racial biases in NLP tools for child protective services""?","Although much literature has established the presence of demographic bias in natural language processing (NLP) models, most work relies on curated bias metrics that may not be reflective of real-world applications. At the same time, practitioners are increasingly using algorithmic tools in high-stakes settings, with particular recent interest in NLP. In this work, we focus on one such setting: child protective services (CPS). CPS workers often write copious free-form text notes about families they are working with, and CPS agencies are actively seeking to deploy NLP models to leverage these data. Given well-established racial bias in this setting, we investigate possible ways deployed NLP is liable to increase racial disparities. We specifically examine word statistics within notes and algorithmic fairness in risk prediction, coreference resolution, and named entity recognition (NER). We document consistent algorithmic unfairness in NER models, possible algorithmic unfairness in coreference resolution models, and little evidence of exacerbated racial bias in risk prediction. While there is existing pronounced criticism of risk prediction, our results expose previously undocumented risks of racial bias in realistic information extraction systems, highlighting potential concerns in deploying them, even though they may appear more benign. Our work serves as a rare realistic examination of NLP algorithmic fairness in a potential deployed setting and a timely investigation of a specific risk associated with deploying NLP in CPS settings."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Practical Probabilistic Model-based Deep Reinforcement Learning by Integrating Dropout Uncertainty and Trajectory Sampling""?","This paper addresses the prediction stability, prediction accuracy and control capability of the current probabilistic model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) built on neural networks. A novel approach dropout-based probabilistic ensembles with trajectory sampling (DPETS) is proposed where the system uncertainty is stably predicted by combining the Monte-Carlo dropout and trajectory sampling in one framework. Its loss function is designed to correct the fitting error of neural networks for more accurate prediction of probabilistic models. The state propagation in its policy is extended to filter the aleatoric uncertainty for superior control capability. Evaluated by several Mujoco benchmark control tasks under additional disturbances and one practical robot arm manipulation task, DPETS outperforms related MBRL approaches in both average return and convergence velocity while achieving superior performance than well-known model-free baselines with significant sample efficiency.

In this paper, we perform a comparative study of how humans annotate two categorizations of multimodal interactions: (1) partial labels, where different annotators annotate the label given the first, second, and both modalities, and (2) counterfactual labels, where the same annotator annotates the label given the first modality before asking them to explicitly reason about how their answer changes when given the second. We further propose an alternative taxonomy based on (3) information decomposition, where annotators annotate the degrees of redundancy: the extent to which modalities individually and together give the same predictions, uniqueness: the extent to which one modality enables a prediction that the other does not, and synergy: the extent to which both modalities enable one to make a prediction that one would not otherwise make using individual modalities. Through experiments and annotations, we highlight several opportunities and limitations of each approach and propose a method to automatically convert annotations of partial and counterfactual labels to information decomposition, yielding an accurate and efficient method for quantifying multimodal interactions."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""The unconventional Myosin-1C augments endothelial secretion of von Willebrand factor by linking contractile actomyosin machinery to the plasma membrane""?","Blood endothelial cells control the hemostatic and inflammatory response by secreting von Willebrand factor (VWF) and P-selectin from storage organelles called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB). Actin-associated motor proteins regulate this secretory pathway at multiple points. Prior to fusion, myosin Va forms a complex that anchors WPBs to peripheral actin structures allowing maturation of content. Post-fusion, an actomyosin ring/coat is recruited and compresses to forcibly expel the largest VWF multimers. Here we provide the first evidence for the involvement of class I myosins during regulated VWF secretion. We show that unconventional myosin-1C (Myo1c) is recruited post fusion via its pleckstrin homology domain in an actin-independent process providing a link between the actin ring and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the membrane of the fused organelle. This is necessary to ensure maximal VWF secretion in response to secretagogue stimulation. Inhibition of class I myosins using the inhibitor Pentachloropseudilin alters the kinetics of the exocytic actin ring. These data offer new insight into the control of an essential physiological process and provide a new potential way in which it might be therapeutically controlled. SIGNFICANCE STATEMENT Myosin motors play diverse roles in regulated secretion. In endothelial cells, the role of conventional myosins (e.g. non-muscle myosin II) are well described however little is known about the requirement of unconventional myosins. Our data identify an important function of the class 1 myosin, Myosin-1C, in the actomyosin mediated expulsion of an essential blood clotting factor (von Willebrand factor) from endothelial cells. This is the first description of how class 1 myosins contribute to primary hemostasis and is therefore greatly improves our understanding of a fundamental physiological process."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields""?","3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which highfidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs. The first is sampling-invariant content transformation that makes the transformation invariant to the holistic statistics of the sampled 3D points and accordingly ensures multi-view consistency. The second is deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps which is equivalent to the transformation of 3D points but greatly reduces memory footprint without degrading multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.

One such task is Computer-Assisted Coding (CAC) which has improved significantly in recent years, thanks to advances in machine learning technologies. Yet simply predicting a set of final codes for a patient encounter is insufficient as CAC systems are required to provide supporting textual evidence to justify the billing codes. A model able to produce accurate and reliable supporting evidence for each code would be a tremendous benefit. However, a human annotated code evidence corpus is extremely difficult to create because it requires specialized knowledge. In this paper, we introduce MDACE, the first publicly available code evidence dataset, which is built on a subset of the MIMIC-III clinical records. The dataset – annotated by professional medical coders – consists of 302 Inpatient charts with 3,934 evidence spans and 52 Profee charts with 5,563 evidence spans. We implemented several evidence extraction methods based on the EffectiveCAN model (Liu et al., 2021) to establish baseline performance on this dataset. MDACE can be used to evaluate code evidence extraction methods for CAC systems, as well as the accuracy and interpretability of deep learning models for multi-label classification. We believe that the release of MDACE will greatly improve the understanding and application of deep learning technologies for medical coding and document classification."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""The Hidden Dance of Phonemes and Visage: Unveiling the Enigmatic Link between Phonemes and Facial Features""?","This work unveils the enigmatic link between phonemes and facial features. Traditional studies on voice-face correlations typically involve using a long period of voice input, including generating face images from voices and reconstructing 3D face meshes from voices. However, in situations like voice-based crimes, the available voice evidence may be short and limited. Additionally, from a physiological perspective, each segment of speech -- phoneme -- corresponds to different types of airflow and movements in the face. Therefore, it is advantageous to discover the hidden link between phonemes and face attributes. In this paper, we propose an analysis pipeline to help us explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.e., phonemes v.s. facial anthropometric measurements (AM). We build an estimator for each phoneme-AM pair and evaluate the correlation through hypothesis testing. Our results indicate that AMs are more predictable from vowels compared to consonants, particularly with plosives. Additionally, we observe that if a specific AM exhibits more movement during phoneme pronunciation, it is more predictable. Our findings support those in physiology regarding correlation and lay the groundwork for future research on speech-face multimodal learning."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""The Relationship between the Serum NLRP1 Level and Coronary Lesions in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease""?","Background The pathogenesis of coronary artery disease is complex, and inflammation is one of the regulatory factors. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1) plays an important role in the cellular inflammatory response, cell apoptosis, cell death, and autoimmune diseases. Whether the level of NLRP1 is related to the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been reported. Objective To test the serum level of NLRP1 in unstable angina (UA) patients and investigate the effect of NLRP1 on coronary stenosis severity of the coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods 307 patients hospitalized in the Department of Cardiology of the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University for coronary angiography from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022 were included. We detect the level of NLRP1 in the serum of the included patients. Patients were divided into UA group and control group according to coronary angiography results and other clinical data. We use logistic regression to screen the influencing factors of UA. Then, subgroups were divided according to the Gensini score and the number of coronary artery lesions, and the difference of serum NLRP1 level between the groups was compared. Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between the serum NLRP1 level and Gensini score. We analyze the diagnostic value of NLRP1 for UA by drawing ROC curve. Results The median level of serum NLRP1 in patients with UA (n = 257) was 49.71 pg/ml, IQR 30.15, 80.21, and that in patients without UA (n = 50) was 24.75 pg/ml, IQR 13.49, 41.95. Serum NLRP1 levels were significantly different among different subgroups. The patient's Gensini score was correlated with the patient's serum NLRP1 level. Conclusion The serum NLRP1 level is increased in patients with UA, which is increased with the increasing severity of coronary lesions."

We extend this work by exploring the impact of linguistic representations on cross-domain performance in a few-shot transfer setting. An important question is whether linguistic representations enhance generalizability by providing features that function as cross-domain pivots. We focus on the task of relation extraction on three datasets of procedural text in two domains, cooking and materials science. Our approach augments a popular transformer-based architecture by alternately incorporating syntactic and semantic graphs constructed by freely available off-the-shelf tools. We examine their utility for enhancing generalization, and investigate whether earlier findings, e.g. that semantic representations can be more helpful than syntactic ones, extend to relation extraction in multiple domains. We find that while the inclusion of these graphs results in significantly higher performance in few-shot transfer, both types of graph exhibit roughly equivalent utility."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Never-ending Learning of User Interfaces""?","Machine learning models have been trained to predict semantic information about user interfaces (UIs) to make apps more accessible, easier to test, and to automate. Currently, most models rely on datasets of static screenshots that are labeled by human annotators, a process that is costly and surprisingly error-prone for certain tasks. For example, workers labeling whether a UI element is “tappable” from a screenshot must guess using visual signifiers, and do not have the benefit of tapping on the UI element in the running app and observing the effects. In this paper, we present the Never-ending UI Learner, an app crawler that automatically installs real apps from a mobile app store and crawls them to infer semantic properties of UIs by interacting with UI elements, discovering new and challenging training examples to learn from, and continually updating machine learning models designed to predict these semantics. The Never-ending UI Learner so far has crawled for more than 5,000 device-hours, performing over half a million actions on 6,000 apps to train three computer vision models for i) tappability prediction, ii) draggability prediction, and iii) screen similarity."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Incremental Learning of Humanoid Robot Behavior from Natural Interaction and Large Language Models""?","Natural-language dialog is key for intuitive human-robot interaction. It can be used not only to express humans' intents, but also to communicate instructions for improvement if a robot does not understand a command correctly. Of great importance is to endow robots with the ability to learn from such interaction experience in an incremental way to allow them to improve their behaviors or avoid mistakes in the future. In this paper, we propose a system to achieve incremental learning of complex behavior from natural interaction, and demonstrate its implementation on a humanoid robot. Building on recent advances, we present a system that deploys Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level orchestration of the robot's behavior, based on the idea of enabling the LLM to generate Python statements in an interactive console to invoke both robot perception and action. The interaction loop is closed by feeding back human instructions, environment observations, and execution results to the LLM, thus informing the generation of the next statement. Specifically, we introduce incremental prompt learning, which enables the system to interactively learn from its mistakes. For that purpose, the LLM can call another LLM responsible for code-level improvements of the current interaction based on human feedback. The improved interaction is then saved in the robot's memory, and thus retrieved on similar requests. We integrate the system in the robot cognitive architecture of the humanoid robot ARMAR-6 and evaluate our methods both quantitatively (in simulation) and qualitatively (in simulation and real-world) by demonstrating generalized incrementally-learned knowledge."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Bayes Risk Transducer: Transducer with Controllable Alignment Prediction""?","Automatic speech recognition (ASR) based on transducers is widely used. In training, a transducer maximizes the summed posteriors of all paths. The path with the highest posterior is commonly defined as the predicted alignment between the speech and the transcription. While the vanilla transducer does not have a prior preference for any of the valid paths, this work intends to enforce the preferred paths and achieve controllable alignment prediction. Specifically, this work proposes Bayes Risk Transducer (BRT), which uses a Bayes risk function to set lower risk values to the preferred paths so that the predicted alignment is more likely to satisfy specific desired properties. We further demonstrate that these predicted alignments with intentionally designed properties can provide practical advantages over the vanilla transducer. Experimentally, the proposed BRT saves inference cost by up to 46% for non-streaming ASR and reduces overall system latency by 41% for streaming ASR."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""BAC Transgenic Expression of Human TREM2-R47H Remodels Amyloid Plaques but Unable to Reprogram Plaque-associated Microglial Reactivity in 5xFAD Mice""?","Background Genetic study of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) reveals that a rare Arginine-to-Histamine mutation at amino acid residue 47 (R47H) in Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) results in increased disease risk. TREM2 plays critical roles in regulating microglial response to amyloid plaques in AD, leading to their clustering and activation surrounding the plaques. We previously showed that increasing human TREM2 gene dosage exerts neuroprotective effects against AD-related deficits in amyloid depositing mouse models of AD. However, the in vivo effects of the R47H mutation on human TREM2-mediated microglial reprogramming and neuroprotection remains poorly understood. Method Here we created a BAC transgenic mouse model expressing human TREM2 with the R47H mutation in its cognate genomic context (BAC-TREM2-R47H). Importantly, the BAC used in this study was engineered to delete critical exons of other TREM-like genes on the BAC to prevent confounding effects of overexpressing multiple TREM-like genes. We crossed BAC-TREM2- R47H mice with 5xFAD [1], an amyloid depositing mouse model of AD, to evaluate amyloid pathologies and microglial phenotypes, transcriptomics and in situ expression of key TREM2-dosage dependent genes. We also compared the key findings in 5xFAD/BAC-TREM2-R47H to those observed in 5xFAD/BAC-TREM2 mice. Result Both BAC-TREM2 and BAC-TREM2-R47H showed proper expression of three splicing isoforms of TREM2 that are normally found in human. In 5xFAD background, elevated TREM2-R47H gene dosages significantly reduced the plaque burden, especially the filamentous type. The results were consistent with enhanced phagocytosis and altered NLRP3 inflammasome activation in BAC- TREM2-R47H microglia in vitro. However, unlike TREM2 overexpression, elevated TREM2- R47H in 5xFAD failed to ameliorate cognitive and transcriptomic deficits. In situ analysis of key TREM2-dosage dependent genes and microglial morphology uncovered that TREM2-R47H showed a loss-of-function phenotype in reprogramming of plaque-associated microglial reactivity and gene expression in 5xFAD. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the AD-risk variant has a previously unknown, mixture of partial and full loss of TREM2 functions in modulating microglial response in AD mouse brains. Together, our new BAC-TREM2-R47H model and prior BAC-TREM2 mice are invaluable resource to facilitate the therapeutic discovery that target human TREM2 and its R47H variant to ameliorate AD and other neurodegenerative disorders."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Can Large Language Models Infer Causation from Correlation?""?","Causal inference is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. While the field of CausalNLP has attracted much interest in the recent years, existing causal inference datasets in NLP primarily rely on discovering causality from empirical knowledge (e.g., commonsense knowledge). In this work, we propose the first benchmark dataset to test the pure causal inference skills of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we formulate a novel task Corr2Cause, which takes a set of correlational statements and determines the causal relationship between the variables. We curate a large-scale dataset of more than 200K samples, on which we evaluate seventeen existing LLMs. Through our experiments, we identify a key shortcoming of LLMs in terms of their causal inference skills, and show that these models achieve almost close to random performance on the task. This shortcoming is somewhat mitigated when we try to re-purpose LLMs for this skill via finetuning, but we find that these models still fail to generalize -- they can only perform causal inference in in-distribution settings when variable names and textual expressions used in the queries are similar to those in the training set, but fail in out-of-distribution settings generated by perturbing these queries. Corr2Cause is a challenging task for LLMs, and would be helpful in guiding future research on improving LLMs' pure reasoning skills and generalizability.

Macrosomes strongly inhibited β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and rescued cells from Aβ misfolding–induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, macrosome administration reduced Aβ plaques and ameliorated cognitive impairment in mice with AD. In contrast, small EVs slightly promoted Aβ aggregation and did not improve AD pathology. Proteomic analysis of small EVs and macrosomes revealed that macrosomes harbor several important neuroprotective proteins that inhibit Aβ misfolding.

Despite its practical appeal, naive multitask retrieval lags behind task-specific retrieval, in which a separate retriever is trained for each task. We show that it is possible to train a multitask retriever that outperforms task-specific retrievers by promoting task specialization. The main ingredients are: (1) a better choice of pretrained model—one that is explicitly optimized for multitasking—along with compatible prompting, and (2) a novel adaptive learning method that encourages each parameter to specialize in a particular task. The resulting multitask retriever is highly performant on the KILT benchmark. Upon analysis, we find that the model indeed learns parameters that are more task-specialized compared to naive multitasking without prompting or adaptive learning.1"

Currently there are no international EQA schemes for seasonal influenza serology testing. Here we present a feasibility study for conducting an EQA scheme for influenza serology methods. Methods We invited participant laboratories from industry, contract research organizations (CROs), academia and public health institutions who regularly conduct hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) assays and have an interest in serology standardization. In total 16 laboratories returned data including 19 data sets for HAI assays and 9 data sets for MN assays. Results Within run analysis demonstrated good laboratory performance for HAI, with intrinsically higher levels of intra-assay variation for MN assays. Between run analysis showed laboratory and strain specific issues, particularly with B strains for HAI, whilst MN testing was consistently good across labs and strains. Inter-laboratory variability was higher for MN assays than HAI, however both assays showed a significant reduction in inter-laboratory variation when a human sera pool is used as a standard for normalization. Discussion This study has received positive feedback from participants, highlighting the benefit such an EQA scheme would have on improving laboratory performance, reducing inter laboratory variation and raising awareness of both harmonized protocol use and the benefit of biological standards for seasonal influenza serology testing."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Speech Summarization of Long Spoken Document: Improving Memory Efficiency of Speech/Text Encoders""?","Speech summarization requires processing several minute-long speech sequences to allow exploiting the whole context of a spoken document. A conventional approach is a cascade of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text summarization (TS). However, the cascade systems are sensitive to ASR errors. Moreover, the cascade system cannot be optimized for input speech and utilize para-linguistic information. Recently, there has been an increased interest in end-to-end (E2E) approaches optimized to output summaries directly from speech. Such systems can thus mitigate the ASR errors of cascade approaches. However, E2E speech summarization requires massive computational resources because it needs to encode long speech sequences. We propose a speech summarization system that enables E2E summarization from 100 seconds, which is the limit of the conventional method, to up to 10 minutes (i.e., the duration of typical instructional videos on YouTube). However, the modeling capability of this model for minute-long speech sequences is weaker than the conventional approach. We thus exploit auxiliary text information from ASR transcriptions to improve the modeling capabilities. The resultant system consists of a dual speech/text encoder decoder-based summarization system. We perform experiments on the How2 dataset showing the proposed system improved METEOR scores by up to 2.7 points by fully exploiting the long spoken documents."

This research, rooted in the exploration of proprietary sender-side denoising effects, meticulously evaluates platforms such as Google Meets and Zoom. The study draws upon the Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) 2020 dataset, ensuring a structured examination tailored to various denoising settings and receiver interfaces. A methodological novelty is introduced via the Oaxaca decomposition, traditionally an econometric tool, repurposed herein to analyze acoustic-phonetic perturbations within VoIP systems. To further ground the implications of these transformations, psychoacoustic metrics, specifically PESQ and STOI, were harnessed to furnish a comprehensive understanding of speech alterations. Cumulatively, the insights garnered underscore the intricate landscape of VoIP-influenced acoustic dynamics. In addition to the primary findings, a multitude of metrics are reported, extending the research purview.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""A Neural PDE Solver with Temporal Stencil Modeling""?","Numerical simulation of non-linear partial differential equations plays a crucial role in modeling physical science and engineering phenomena, such as weather, climate, and aerodynamics. Recent Machine Learning (ML) models trained on low-resolution spatio-temporal signals have shown new promises in capturing important dynamics in high-resolution signals, under the condition that the models can effectively recover the missing details. However, this study shows that significant information is often lost in the low-resolution down-sampled features. To address such issues, we propose a new approach, namely Temporal Stencil Modeling (TSM), which combines the strengths of advanced time-series sequence modeling (with the HiPPO features) and state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers (with learnable stencil modeling). TSM aims to recover the lost information from the PDE trajectories and can be regarded as a temporal generalization of classic finite volume methods such as WENO. Our experimental results show that TSM achieves the new state-of-the-art simulation accuracy for 2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulent flows: it significantly outperforms the previously reported best results by 19.9% in terms of the highly-correlated duration time and reduces the inference latency into 80%. We also show a strong generalization ability of the proposed method to various out-of-distribution turbulent flow settings. Our code is available at""https://github.com/Edward-Sun/TSM-PDE""."

Enhancing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), GLoRA employs a generalized prompt module to optimize pre-trained model weights and adjust intermediate activations, providing more flexibility and capability across diverse tasks and datasets. Moreover, GLoRA facilitates efficient parameter adaptation by employing a scalable, modular, layer-wise structure search that learns individual adapter of each layer. Originating from a unified mathematical formulation, GLoRA exhibits strong transfer learning, few-shot learning and domain generalization abilities, as it adapts to new tasks through not only weights but also additional dimensions like activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GLoRA outperforms all previous methods in natural, specialized, and structured vision benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy with fewer parameters and computations. The proposed method on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 also show considerable enhancements compared to the original LoRA in the language domain. Furthermore, our structural re-parameterization design ensures that GLoRA incurs no extra inference cost, rendering it a practical solution for resource-limited applications.

Additionally, we propose context dropout to ensure robustness to the absence of context, and further improve performance by adding speaker information. Our proposed contextual E2E-ST outperforms the isolated utterance-based E2E-ST approach.

We then evaluate all models on 57 out-of-domain tasks drawn from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark, covering 26 distinct reasoning skills, utilizing three prompting techniques. Through a comprehensive grid of 27 configurations and 6,156 test evaluations, we investigate the dimensions of finetuning, prompting, and scale to understand the role of explanations on different reasoning skills. Our findings reveal that having explanations in the fewshot exemplar has no significant impact on the model’s performance when the model is finetuned, while positively affecting the non-finetuned counterpart. Moreover, we observe a slight yet consistent increase in classification accuracy as we incorporate explanations during prompting and finetuning, respectively.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""BASS: Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization""?","End-to-end speech summarization has been shown to improve performance over cascade baselines. However, such models are difficult to train on very large inputs (dozens of minutes or hours) owing to compute restrictions and are hence trained with truncated model inputs. Truncation leads to poorer models, and a solution to this problem rests in block-wise modeling, i.e., processing a portion of the input frames at a time. In this paper, we develop a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner. Speech summarization is realized as a streaming process, where hypothesis summaries are updated every block based on new acoustic information. We devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks. Experiments on the How2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed block-wise training method improves by 3 points absolute on ROUGE-L over a truncated input baseline."

To achieve comprehensive coverage of diverse speech tasks and harness instruction tuning, we invite the community to collaborate and contribute, facilitating the dynamic growth of the benchmark.

Additionally, we propose several approaches to establish benchmark baselines. These include the utilization of speech models, text language models, and the multimodal encoder. Evaluation results indicate that while these baselines perform reasonably on seen tasks, they struggle with unseen ones.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Paaploss: A Phonetic-Aligned Acoustic Parameter Loss for Speech Enhancement""?","Despite rapid advancement in recent years, current speech enhancement models often produce speech that differs in perceptual quality from real clean speech. We propose a learning objective that formalizes differences in perceptual quality, by using domain knowledge of acoustic-phonetics. We identify temporal acoustic parameters – such as spectral tilt, spectral flux, shimmer, etc. – that are non-differentiable, and we develop a neural network estimator that can accurately predict their time-series values across an utterance. We also model phoneme-specific weights for each feature, as the acoustic parameters are known to show different behavior in different phonemes. We can add this criterion as an auxiliary loss to any model that produces speech, to optimize speech outputs to match the values of clean speech in these features. Experimentally we show that it improves speech enhancement workflows in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, as measured by standard evaluation metrics. We also provide an analysis of phoneme-dependent improvement on acoustic parameters, demonstrating the additional interpretability that our method provides. This analysis can suggest which features are currently the bottleneck for improvement."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Rethinking Audiovisual Segmentation with Semantic Quantization and Decomposition""?","Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) is a challenging task that aims to segment visual objects in videos based on their associated acoustic cues. With multiple sound sources involved, establishing robust correspondences between audio and visual contents poses unique challenges due to its (1) intricate entanglement across sound sources and (2) frequent shift among sound events. Assuming sound events occur independently, the multi-source semantic space (which encompasses all possible semantic categories) can be represented as the Cartesian product of single-source sub-spaces. This motivates us to decompose the multi-source audio semantics into single-source semantics, enabling more effective interaction with visual content. Specifically, we propose a semantic decomposition method based on product quantization, where the multi-source semantics can be decomposed and represented by several quantized single-source semantics. Furthermore, we introduce a global-to-local quantization mechanism, which distills knowledge from stable global (clip-level) features into local (frame-level) ones, to handle the constant shift of audio semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that semantically quantized and decomposed audio representation significantly improves AVS performance, e.g., +21.2% mIoU on the most challenging AVS-Semantic benchmark."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Neural Mixed Effects for Nonlinear Personalized Predictions""?","Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that predicts a person’s future observations based on their past labeled observations and is typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a) trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: ruling out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere in a neural network in a scalable manner1. NME combines the efficiency of neural network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the mothers experience symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states. Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset shows interpretable trends related to the mother’s depression symptoms."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""A Gold Standard Dataset for the Reviewer Assignment Problem""?","Many peer-review venues are either using or looking to use algorithms to assign submissions to reviewers. The crux of such automated approaches is the notion of the""similarity score""--a numerical estimate of the expertise of a reviewer in reviewing a paper--and many algorithms have been proposed to compute these scores. However, these algorithms have not been subjected to a principled comparison, making it difficult for stakeholders to choose the algorithm in an evidence-based manner. The key challenge in comparing existing algorithms and developing better algorithms is the lack of the publicly available gold-standard data that would be needed to perform reproducible research. We address this challenge by collecting a novel dataset of similarity scores that we release to the research community. Our dataset consists of 477 self-reported expertise scores provided by 58 researchers who evaluated their expertise in reviewing papers they have read previously. We use this data to compare several popular algorithms employed in computer science conferences and come up with recommendations for stakeholders. Our main findings are as follows. First, all algorithms make a non-trivial amount of error. For the task of ordering two papers in terms of their relevance for a reviewer, the error rates range from 12%-30% in easy cases to 36%-43% in hard cases, highlighting the vital need for more research on the similarity-computation problem. Second, most existing algorithms are designed to work with titles and abstracts of papers, and in this regime the Specter+MFR algorithm performs best. Third, to improve performance, it may be important to develop modern deep-learning based algorithms that can make use of the full texts of papers: the classical TD-IDF algorithm enhanced with full texts of papers is on par with the deep-learning based Specter+MFR that cannot make use of this information."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Do All Languages Cost the Same? Tokenization in the Era of Commercial Language Models""?","Language models have graduated from being research prototypes to commercialized products offered as web APIs, and recent works have highlighted the multilingual capabilities of these products. The API vendors charge their users based on usage, more specifically on the number of ``tokens'' processed or generated by the underlying language models. What constitutes a token, however, is training data and model dependent with a large variance in the number of tokens required to convey the same information in different languages. In this work, we analyze the effect of this non-uniformity on the fairness of an API's pricing policy across languages. We conduct a systematic analysis of the cost and utility of OpenAI's language model API on multilingual benchmarks in 22 typologically diverse languages. We show evidence that speakers of a large number of the supported languages are overcharged while obtaining poorer results. These speakers tend to also come from regions where the APIs are less affordable to begin with. Through these analyses, we aim to increase transparency around language model APIs' pricing policies and encourage the vendors to make them more equitable."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Acupuncture Alleviates CUMS-Induced Depression-Like Behaviors by Restoring Prefrontal Cortex Neuroplasticity""?","Purpose To explore the therapeutic efficiency of acupuncture and the related molecular mechanism of neural plasticity in depression. Methods Chronic unpredictable mild stress- (CUMS-) induced rats were established for the depression animal model. There were a total of four rat groups, including the control group, the CUMS group, the CUMS+acupuncture group, and the CUMS+fluoxetine group. The acupuncture group and the fluoxetine group were given a 3-week treatment after the modeling intervention. The researcher performed the open-field, elevated plus maze, and sucrose preference tests to evaluate depressive behaviors. The number of nerve cells, dendrites' length, and the prefrontal cortex's spine density were detected using Golgi staining. The prefrontal cortex expression, such as BDNF, PSD95, SYN, and PKMZ protein, was detected using the western blot and RT-PCR. Results Acupuncture could alleviate depressive-like behaviors and promote the recovery of the neural plasticity functions in the prefrontal cortex, showing the increasing cell numbers, prolonging the length of the dendrites, and enhancing the spine density. The neural plasticity-related proteins in the prefrontal cortex, including BDNF, PSD95, SYN, and PKMZ, were all downregulated in the CUMS-induced group; however, these effects could be partly reversed after being treated by acupuncture and fluoxetine (P < 0.05). Conclusion Acupuncture can ameliorate depressive-like behaviors by promoting the recovery of neural plasticity functions and neural plasticity-related protein upregulation in the prefrontal cortex of CUMS-induced depressed rats. Our study provides new insights into the antidepressant approach, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of acupuncture involved in depression treatment."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Viscoelastic Property of the Brain Assessed With Magnetic Resonance Elastography and Its Association With Glymphatic System in Neurologically Normal Individuals""?","Objective To investigate the feasibility of assessing the viscoelastic properties of the brain using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and a novel MRE transducer to determine the relationship between the viscoelastic properties and glymphatic function in neurologically normal individuals. Materials and Methods This prospective study included 47 neurologically normal individuals aged 23–74 years (male-to-female ratio, 21:26). The MRE was acquired using a gravitational transducer based on a rotational eccentric mass as the driving system. The magnitude of the complex shear modulus |G*| and the phase angle φ were measured in the centrum semiovale area. To evaluate glymphatic function, the Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis Along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) method was utilized and the ALPS index was calculated. Univariable and multivariable (variables with P < 0.2 from the univariable analysis) linear regression analyses were performed for |G*| and φ and included sex, age, normalized white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, brain parenchymal volume, and ALPS index as covariates. Results In the univariable analysis for |G*|, age (P = 0.005), brain parenchymal volume (P = 0.152), normalized WMH volume (P = 0.011), and ALPS index (P = 0.005) were identified as candidates with P < 0.2. In the multivariable analysis, only the ALPS index was independently associated with |G*|, showing a positive relationship (β = 0.300, P = 0.029). For φ, normalized WMH volume (P = 0.128) and ALPS index (P = 0.015) were identified as candidates for multivariable analysis, and only the ALPS index was independently associated with φ (β = 0.057, P = 0.039). Conclusion Brain MRE using a gravitational transducer is feasible in neurologically normal individuals over a wide age range. The significant correlation between the viscoelastic properties of the brain and glymphatic function suggests that a more organized or preserved microenvironment of the brain parenchyma is associated with a more unimpeded glymphatic fluid flow."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""A simple food with many meanings: bread in late medieval England""?","ABSTRACT Bread was the most important item of diet in medieval England. Cereals were consumed in boiled form, but bread was preferred. Bread was not just convenient, but was also symbolic of well-being. Although breads were made from other cereals and legumes, wheat bread occupied a prime position, and in particular white wheat bread was regarded highly by consumers. Reasons are given for these attitudes, including the practical advantage that white bread was an efficient source of energy and was cost-effective. The political management of the corn trade and bread baking through such regulations as the assize of bread was intended to prevent unrest, but occasionally consumers organised ‘food riots’."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Exploring the Relationship Between Model Architecture and In-Context Learning Ability""?","What is the relationship between model architecture and the ability to perform in-context learning? In this empirical study, we take the first steps toward answering this question. We evaluate twelve model architectures capable of causal language modeling across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks. These selected architectures represent a broad range of paradigms, including recurrent and convolution-based neural networks, transformers, state-space model inspired, and other emerging attention alternatives. We discover that all the considered architectures can perform in-context learning under a wider range of conditions than previously documented. Additionally, we observe stark differences in statistical efficiency and consistency by varying context length and task difficulty. We also measure each architecture's predisposition towards in-context learning when presented with alternative routes for task resolution. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we find that several attention alternatives are more robust in-context learners than transformers. Given that such approaches have constant-sized memory footprints at inference time, this result opens the possibility of scaling up in-context learning to accommodate vastly larger numbers of in-context examples."

The Zn-doped CuI TFT exhibited a more superior on/off current ratio than CuI TFT due to the substitution or supplementation of copper vacancies by Zn ions. The Zn-doped CuI films were characterized by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Zn-doped CuI TFTs exhibited an on/off current ratio of 1.58 × 104, a subthreshold swing of 70 mV/decade, and a field effect mobility of 0.40 cm2V−1s−1, demonstrating good operational stability. Due to the electric-double-layer (EDL) effect and high specific capacitance (17.3 μF/cm2) of chitosan gate dielectric, Zn-doped CuI TFT operates at a voltage below −2 V. The threshold voltage is −0.2 V. In particular, we have prepared Zn-doped CuI TFTs with two in-plane gates and NOR logic operation is implemented on such TFTs. In addition, using the ion relaxation effect and EDL effect of chitosan film, a simple pain neuron simulation is realized on such a p-type TFTs for the first time through the bottom gate to regulate the carrier transport of the channel. This p-type device has promising applications in low-cost electronic devices, complementary electronic circuit, and biosensors."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""BASS: Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization""?","End-to-end speech summarization has been shown to improve performance over cascade baselines. However, such models are difficult to train on very large inputs (dozens of minutes or hours) owing to compute restrictions and are hence trained with truncated model inputs. Truncation leads to poorer models, and a solution to this problem rests in block-wise modeling, i.e., processing a portion of the input frames at a time. In this paper, we develop a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner. Speech summarization is realized as a streaming process, where hypothesis summaries are updated every block based on new acoustic information. We devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks. Experiments on the How2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed block-wise training method improves by 3 points absolute on ROUGE-L over a truncated input baseline."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Characterisation and Dynamics of an Emerging Seagrass Meadow""?","Seagrasses are habitat-forming species that support biodiversity and a wide range of associated ecosystem services, from blue carbon capture to providing nursery areas for a variety of organisms. Their decline has been documented worldwide and is attributed to human impacts ranging from habitat loss and eutrophication to the effects of climate change. However, recent recovery trends have also been documented due to reductions in stressors, passive and active restoration, and even changes in environmental conditions owing to local management. In this study, we document for the first time the occurrence of Zostera noltei in the downstream area of the River Minho Estuary. This occurrence was unexpected given the hydrological conditions of the estuary, characterised by dredging and siltation. We reconstructed the occurrence and historical distribution of seagrass beds, and showed that they have existed in the region for more than a decade. The current distribution area was mapped using high-resolution multispectral remote sensing techniques, and in situ photoquadrats to complement the remote sensing information with an evaluation of the seagrass cover. A current seagrass area of 0.81 ha was found with an average cover of 70%. However, the Minho Estuary continues to be strongly affected by sediment deposition, which may affect the seagrass population in the long term. Continued surveys are recommended to confirm the long-term trend of colonisation of this important habitat, which ultimately provides so many benefits to coastal ecosystems and humankind."

Specifically, by providing multiple types of conditions including self-supervised learning embeddings and proper text prompts to the score-based diffusion model, we can enable controllable generation of the unified speech enhancement and editing model to perform corresponding actions on the source speech. Our experiments show that our proposed uSee model can achieve superior performance in both speech denoising and dereverberation compared to other related generative speech enhancement models, and can perform speech editing given desired environmental sound text description, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and room impulse responses (RIR).

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Rethinking Audiovisual Segmentation with Semantic Quantization and Decomposition""?","Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) is a challenging task that aims to segment visual objects in videos based on their associated acoustic cues. With multiple sound sources involved, establishing robust correspondences between audio and visual contents poses unique challenges due to its (1) intricate entanglement across sound sources and (2) frequent shift among sound events. Assuming sound events occur independently, the multi-source semantic space (which encompasses all possible semantic categories) can be represented as the Cartesian product of single-source sub-spaces. This motivates us to decompose the multi-source audio semantics into single-source semantics, enabling more effective interaction with visual content. Specifically, we propose a semantic decomposition method based on product quantization, where the multi-source semantics can be decomposed and represented by several quantized single-source semantics. Furthermore, we introduce a global-to-local quantization mechanism, which distills knowledge from stable global (clip-level) features into local (frame-level) ones, to handle the constant shift of audio semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that semantically quantized and decomposed audio representation significantly improves AVS performance, e.g., +21.2% mIoU on the most challenging AVS-Semantic benchmark."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Assessment of Meningeal Lymphatics in the Parasagittal Dural Space: A Prospective Feasibility Study Using Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging""?","Objective Meningeal lymphatic vessels are predominantly located in the parasagittal dural space (PSD); these vessels drain interstitial fluids out of the brain and contribute to the glymphatic system. We aimed to investigate the ability of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in assessing the dynamic changes in the meningeal lymphatic vessels in PSD. Materials and Methods Eighteen participants (26–71 years; male:female, 10:8), without neurological or psychiatric diseases, were prospectively enrolled and underwent DCE-MRI. Three regions of interests (ROIs) were placed on the PSD, superior sagittal sinus (SSS), and cortical vein. Early and delayed enhancement patterns and six kinetic curve-derived parameters were obtained and compared between the three ROIs. Moreover, the participants were grouped into the young (< 65 years; n = 9) or older (≥ 65 years; n = 9) groups. Enhancement patterns and kinetic curve-derived parameters in the PSD were compared between the two groups. Results The PSD showed different enhancement patterns than the SSS and cortical veins (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) in the early and delayed phases. The PSD showed slow early enhancement and a delayed wash-out pattern. The six kinetic curve-derived parameters of PSD was significantly different than that of the SSS and cortical vein. The PSD wash-out rate of older participants was significantly lower (median, 0.09; interquartile range [IQR], 0.01–0.15) than that of younger participants (median, 0.32; IQR, 0.07–0.45) (P = 0.040). Conclusion This study shows that the dynamic changes of meningeal lymphatic vessels in PSD can be assessed with DCE-MRI, and the results are different from those of the venous structures. Our finding that delayed wash-out was more pronounced in the PSD of older participants suggests that aging may disturb the meningeal lymphatic drainage."

Three low-nitrogen diamonds from Koffiefontein (South Africa), containing inclusion assemblages of ferropericlase ± orthopyroxene ± magnesite, constrain diamond formation in an Mg-rich lower-mantle environment. Ferropericlase inclusions have Mg# 82.7–88.5 and orthopyroxene inclusions (retrogressed bridgmanite) have Mg# 95.0–95.1 and mantle-like δ18O of +5.6‰ ± 0.2‰. Magnesite included in one diamond implicates carbonated fluids in diamond formation. High Mg# and low Ca, Al, and Na of the assemblage indicate a melt-depleted meta-harzburgitic environment, in contrast to more fertile compositions expected for primitive lower mantle. Extremely low Ca in orthopyroxene inclusions may reflect a combination of melt depletion and low equilibration temperatures at the time of trapping. Inclusion compositions implicate subducted oceanic slab meta-harzburgite as the host for diamond growth. Mantle-like δ18O of the orthopyroxene inclusions indicates unaltered oceanic lithosphere. Similar melt-depleted characteristics in lower-mantle inclusion assemblages worldwide support that meta-harzburgite is the dominant host of lower-mantle diamonds."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""A study of Forbush Decreases effects with DAMPE experiment""?","Forbush Decrease (FD) is a rapid decrease and slow recover in the observed galactic cosmic ray intensity, caused by active solar events sweeping low energy galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) away from Earth. Differnet properties of FDs have been observed by different scientific experiment but mostly from worldwide ground based Neutron Monitors (NMS), they focus on secondary neutron from the atmosphere. The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a satellite-based cosmic-ray experiment that has been stably operated for more than 7 years. Precise measurements of cosmic ray electrons and positrons from DAMPE make it possible to directly study FDs from a new perspective. We analyze the FD properties, such as decrease amplitude and recover time as a function of energy, observed by DAMPE from 2017 to 2021. Finally we simulate the FDs with a numerical model, and successfully reproduce the FDs. The preliminary result shows that the head-on events causes energy related recover time, while edge-on events causes energy unrelated recover time of FDs."

Extensive experiments are conducted on Tiny-ImageNet and full ImageNet-1K datasets. Under 50 IPC, our approach achieves the highest 42.5% and 60.8% validation accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K, outperforming all previous state-of-the-art methods by margins of 14.5% and 32.9%, respectively. Our approach also surpasses MTT in terms of speed by approximately 52$\times$ (ConvNet-4) and 16$\times$ (ResNet-18) faster with less memory consumption of 11.6$\times$ and 6.4$\times$ during data synthesis.

Lastly, the paper discusses the possibility of combining interpolation property and approximating property together, and demonstrates that given any Riemann integrable functions on a compact set in R, with several points on its graph, the finite combination of monotone sigmoidal functions can pass through these points and approximate the given function arbitrarily well with respect to L^1 (dx) (in the sense of Riemann integral) when the number of points getting large."

METHOD CC allows a group leader to establish a commentary group and invite colleagues or students to join as members of the group. Members can then browse through the transcript database using the TalkBank Browser. When they wish to insert a comment, they click on the utterance line number or drag the cursor across a range of utterances and a window opens to receive the comment. The comment can include open text along with codes selected from a predefined set of codes created by that commentary group. RESULTS CC was released for public use in August 2022. It is being used currently in five research projects and eight classes. An important feature of CC is its ability to evaluate the reliability of coding systems and to sharpen analytic categories. By familiarizing instructors and researchers with the capabilities of CC, we expect to see an increasing usage of CC for a variety of clinical and research applications. CONCLUSIONS CC can contribute to a better understanding of connected speech features in aphasia, dementia, right hemisphere disorder, and traumatic brain injury. CC represents an extreme innovation not only for the study of adult neurogenic communication disorders but also for the study of spoken language generally."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Latest results on searching for fractionally charged particles with the DAMPE experiment""?","The existence of fractionally charged particles (FCP) is foreseen in extensions of or beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Most of the previously conducted searches for FCPs in cosmic rays were based on experiments underground or at high altitudes. However, there have been few searches for FCPs in cosmic rays carried out in orbit other than AMS-01 flown by a space shuttle and BESS by a balloon at the top of the atmosphere. In this study, we conduct an FCP search in space based on on-orbit data obtained using the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite over a period of five years. Unlike underground experiments, which require an FCP energy of the order of hundreds of GeV, our FCP search starts at only a few GeV. An upper limit of 6 . 2 × 10 − 10 cm − 2 sr − 1 s − 1 is obtained for the flux. Our results demonstrate that DAMPE exhibits higher sensitivity than experiments of similar types by three orders of magnitude that more stringently restricts the conditions for the existence of FCP in primary cosmic rays."

Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by ~20% absolute on average in task performance.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Ruffle&Riley: Towards the Automated Induction of Conversational Tutoring Systems""?","Conversational tutoring systems (CTSs) offer learning experiences driven by natural language interaction. They are known to promote high levels of cognitive engagement and benefit learning outcomes, particularly in reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, the time and cost required to author CTS content is a major obstacle to widespread adoption. In this paper, we introduce a novel type of CTS that leverages the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) in two ways: First, the system induces a tutoring script automatically from a lesson text. Second, the system automates the script orchestration via two LLM-based agents (Ruffle&Riley) with the roles of a student and a professor in a learning-by-teaching format. The system allows a free-form conversation that follows the ITS-typical inner and outer loop structure. In an initial between-subject online user study (N = 100) comparing Ruffle&Riley to simpler QA chatbots and reading activity, we found no significant differences in post-test scores. Nonetheless, in the learning experience survey, Ruffle&Riley users expressed higher ratings of understanding and remembering and further perceived the offered support as more helpful and the conversation as coherent. Our study provides insights for a new generation of scalable CTS technologies."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Knowledge Crosswords: Geometric Reasoning over Structured Knowledge with Large Language Models""?","Large language models (LLMs) are widely adopted in knowledge-intensive tasks and have achieved impressive performance thanks to their knowledge abilities. While LLMs have demonstrated outstanding performance on atomic or linear (multi-hop) QA tasks, whether they can reason in knowledge-rich scenarios with interweaving constraints remains an underexplored problem. In this work, we propose geometric reasoning over structured knowledge, where pieces of knowledge are connected in a graph structure and models need to fill in the missing information. Such geometric knowledge reasoning would require the ability to handle structured knowledge, reason with uncertainty, verify facts, and backtrack when an error occurs. We propose Knowledge Crosswords, a multi-blank QA dataset where each problem consists of a natural language question representing the geometric constraints of an incomplete entity network, where LLMs are tasked with working out the missing entities while meeting all factual constraints. Knowledge Crosswords contains 2,101 individual problems, covering various knowledge domains and further divided into three difficulty levels. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing LLM prompting approaches on the Knowledge Crosswords benchmark. We additionally propose two new approaches, Staged Prompting and Verify-All, to augment LLMs' ability to backtrack and verify structured constraints. Our results demonstrate that while baseline approaches perform well on easier problems but struggle with hard ones, our proposed Verify-All outperforms other methods by a large margin and is more robust with hard problems. Further analysis reveals that LLMs' ability of geometric reasoning over structured knowledge is still far from robust or perfect, susceptible to confounders such as the order of options, certain structural patterns, assumption of existence of correct answer, and more."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Associated Factors of Spontaneous Hemorrhage in Brain Metastases in Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma""?","Simple Summary Risk factors of hemorrhage in brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma has been unknown and how hemorrhage in brain metastases affects patients’ prognosis has not been clarified. We performed a retrospective analysis on 159 BMs and found that hemorrhage in BMs from lung adenocarcinomas may be associated with BM tumor size and a combination of TKI and intracranial radiotherapy. However, BM hemorrhage did not affect OSBM. Abstract Background: Hemorrhage in brain metastases (BMs) from lung cancer is common and associated with a poor prognosis. Research on associated factors of spontaneous hemorrhage in patients with BMs is limited. This study aimed to investigate the predictive risk factors for BM hemorrhage and assess whether hemorrhage affects patient survival. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 159 BMs from 80 patients with lung adenocarcinoma from January 2017 to May 2022. Patients were classified into hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic groups. Patient demographics, lung cancer molecular subtype, treatment type, and tumor–node–metastasis stage were compared between the groups. Multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis and gradient boosting were performed. To determine whether BM hemorrhage can stratify overall survival after BM (OSBM), univariate survival analysis was performed. Results: In the univariate analysis, hemorrhagic BMs were significantly larger and had a history of receiving combination therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and intracranial radiation (p < 0.05). Multivariate GEE showed that tumor size and combination therapy were independent risk factors for BM hemorrhage (p < 0.05). Gradient boosting demonstrated that the strongest predictor of BM hemorrhage was tumor size (variable importance: 49.83), followed by age (16.65) and TKI combined with intracranial radiation (13.81). There was no significant difference in OSBM between the two groups (p = 0.33). Conclusions: Hemorrhage in BMs from lung adenocarcinomas may be associated with BM tumor size and a combination of TKI and intracranial radiotherapy. BM hemorrhage did not affect OSBM."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Decreased Expression of KLF4 Leading to Functional Deficit in Pediatric Patients with Intestinal Failure and Potential Therapeutic Strategy Using Decanoic Acid""?","Pediatric intestinal failure (IF) is the reduction in gut function to below the minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients and/or water and electrolytes, such that intravenous supplementation is required to maintain health and/or growth. The overall goal in treating IF is to achieve intestinal adaptation; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. In this study, by performing single-cell RNA sequencing in pediatric IF patients, we found that decreased Kruppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4) may serve as the hub gene responsible for the functional deficit in mature enterocytes in IF patients, leading to the downregulation of solute carrier (SLC) family transporters (e.g., SLC7A9) and, consequently, nutrient malabsorption. We also found that inducible KLF4 was highly sensitive to the loss of certain enteral nutrients: in a rodent model of total parenteral nutrition mimicking the deprivation of enteral nutrition, the expression of KLF4 dramatically decreased only at the tip of the villus and not at the bottom of crypts. By using IF patient-derived intestinal organoids and Caco-2 cells as in vitro models, we demonstrated that the supplementation of decanoic acid (DA) could significantly induce the expression of KLF4 along with SLC6A4 and SLC7A9, suggesting that DA may function as a potential therapeutic strategy to promote cell maturation and functional improvement. In summary, this study provides new insights into the mechanism of intestinal adaptation depending on KLF4, and proposed potential strategies for nutritional management using DA."

This limitation has motivated us to develop SYNTACC (Synthesizing speech with accents) which adapts conventional multi-speaker TTS to produce multi-accent speech. Our method uses the YourTTS model and involves a novel multi-accent training mechanism. The method works by decomposing each weight matrix into a shared component and an accent-dependent component, with the former being initialized by the pretrained multi-speaker TTS model and the latter being factorized into vectors using rank-1 matrices to reduce the number of training parameters per accent. This weight factorization method proves to be effective in fine-tuning the SYNTACC on multi-accent data sets in a low-resource condition. Our SYNTACC model eventually allows speech synthesis in not only different voices but also in different accents."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""From Dogwhistles to Bullhorns: Unveiling Coded Rhetoric with Language Models""?","Dogwhistles are coded expressions that simultaneously convey one meaning to a broad audience and a second, often hateful or provocative, meaning to a narrow in-group; they are deployed to evade both political repercussions and algorithmic content moderation. For example, the word “cosmopolitan” in a sentence such as “we need to end the cosmopolitan experiment” can mean “worldly” to many but also secretly mean “Jewish” to a select few. We present the first large-scale computational investigation of dogwhistles. We develop a typology of dogwhistles, curate the largest-to-date glossary of over 300 dogwhistles with rich contextual information and examples, and analyze their usage in historical U.S. politicians’ speeches. We then assess whether a large language model (GPT-3) can identify dogwhistles and their meanings, and find that GPT-3’s performance varies widely across types of dogwhistles and targeted groups. Finally, we show that harmful content containing dogwhistles avoids toxicity detection, highlighting online risks presented by such coded language. This work sheds light on the theoretical and applied importance of dogwhistles in both NLP and computational social science, and provides resources to facilitate future research in modeling dogwhistles and mitigating their online harms."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""UNSSOR: Unsupervised Neural Speech Separation by Leveraging Over-determined Training Mixtures""?","In reverberant conditions with multiple concurrent speakers, each microphone acquires a mixture signal of multiple speakers at a different location. In over-determined conditions where the microphones out-number speakers, we can narrow down the solutions to speaker images and realize unsupervised speech separation by leveraging each mixture signal as a constraint (i.e., the estimated speaker images at a microphone should add up to the mixture). Equipped with this insight, we propose UNSSOR, an algorithm for $\textbf{u}$nsupervised $\textbf{n}$eural $\textbf{s}$peech $\textbf{s}$eparation by leveraging $\textbf{o}$ver-determined training mixtu$\textbf{r}$es. At each training step, we feed an input mixture to a deep neural network (DNN) to produce an intermediate estimate for each speaker, linearly filter the estimates, and optimize a loss so that, at each microphone, the filtered estimates of all the speakers can add up to the mixture to satisfy the above constraint. We show that this loss can promote unsupervised separation of speakers. The linear filters are computed in each sub-band based on the mixture and DNN estimates through the forward convolutive prediction (FCP) algorithm. To address the frequency permutation problem incurred by using sub-band FCP, a loss term based on minimizing intra-source magnitude scattering is proposed. Although UNSSOR requires over-determined training mixtures, we can train DNNs to achieve under-determined separation (e.g., unsupervised monaural speech separation). Evaluation results on two-speaker separation in reverberant conditions show the effectiveness and potential of UNSSOR."

Existing approaches to semi-supervised clustering require a significant amount of feedback from an expert to improve the clusters. In this paper, we ask whether a large language model can amplify an expert's guidance to enable query-efficient, few-shot semi-supervised text clustering. We show that LLMs are surprisingly effective at improving clustering. We explore three stages where LLMs can be incorporated into clustering: before clustering (improving input features), during clustering (by providing constraints to the clusterer), and after clustering (using LLMs post-correction). We find incorporating LLMs in the first two stages can routinely provide significant improvements in cluster quality, and that LLMs enable a user to make trade-offs between cost and accuracy to produce desired clusters. We release our code and LLM prompts for the public to use."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Machine Learning for Predicting Forest Fire Occurrence in Changsha: An Innovative Investigation into the Introduction of a Forest Fuel Factor""?","Affected by global warming and increased extreme weather, Hunan Province saw a phased and concentrated outbreak of forest fires in 2022, causing significant damage and impact. Predicting the occurrence of forest fires can enhance the ability to make early predictions and strengthen early warning and responses. Currently, fire prevention and extinguishing in China’s forests and grasslands face severe challenges due to the overlapping of natural and social factors. Existing forest fire occurrence prediction models mostly take into account vegetation, topographic, meteorological and human activity factors; however, the occurrence of forest fires is closely related to the forest fuel moisture content. In this study, the traditional driving factors of forest fire such as satellite hotspots, vegetation, meteorology, topography and human activities from 2004 to 2021 were introduced along with forest fuel factors (vegetation canopy water content and evapotranspiration from the top of the vegetation canopy), and a database of factors for predicting forest fire occurrence was constructed. And a forest fire occurrence prediction model was built using machine learning methods such as the Random Forest model (RF), the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model (GBDT) and the Adaptive Augmentation Model (AdaBoost). The accuracy of the models was verified using Area Under Curve (AUC) and four other metrics. The RF model with an AUC value of 0.981 was more accurate than all other models in predicting the probability of forest fire occurrence, followed by the GBDT (AUC = 0.978) and AdaBoost (AUC = 0.891) models. The RF model, which has the best accuracy, was selected to predict the monthly forest fire probability in Changsha in 2022 and combined with the Inverse Distance Weight Interpolation method to plot the monthly forest fire probability in Changsha. We found that the monthly spatial and temporal distribution of forest fire probability in Changsha varied significantly, with March, April, May, September, October, November and December being the months with higher forest fire probability. The highest probability of forest fires occurred in the central and northern regions. In this study, the core drivers affecting the occurrence of forest fires in Changsha City were found to be vegetation canopy evapotranspiration and vegetation canopy water content. The RF model was identified as a more suitable forest fire occurrence probability prediction model for Changsha City. Meanwhile, this study found that vegetation characteristics and combustible factors have more influence on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City than meteorological factors, and surface temperature has less influence on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Pragmatic Inference with a CLIP Listener for Contrastive Captioning""?","We propose a simple yet effective and robust method for contrastive captioning: generating discriminative captions that distinguish target images from very similar alternative distractor images. Our approach is built on a pragmatic inference procedure that formulates captioning as a reference game between a speaker, which produces possible captions describing the target, and a listener, which selects the target given the caption. Unlike previous methods that derive both speaker and listener distributions from a single captioning model, we leverage an off-the-shelf CLIP model to parameterize the listener. Compared with captioner-only pragmatic models, our method benefits from rich vision language alignment representations from CLIP when reasoning over distractors. Like previous methods for discriminative captioning, our method uses a hyperparameter to control the tradeoff between the informativity (how likely captions are to allow a human listener to discriminate the target image) and the fluency of the captions. However, we find that our method is substantially more robust to the value of this hyperparameter than past methods, which allows us to automatically optimize the captions for informativity - outperforming past methods for discriminative captioning by 11% to 15% accuracy in human evaluations"

We propose LatticeGen, a cooperative framework in which the server still handles most of the computation while the user controls the sampling operation. The key idea is that the true generated sequence is mixed with noise tokens by the user and hidden in a noised lattice. Considering potential attacks from a hypothetically malicious server and how the user can defend against it, we propose the repeated beam-search attack and the mixing noise scheme. In our experiments we apply LatticeGen to protect both prompt and generation. It is shown that while the noised lattice degrades generation quality, LatticeGen successfully protects the true generation to a remarkable degree under strong attacks (more than 50% of the semantic remains hidden as measured by BERTScore)."

To quantify this variance, we derive the underlying distribution of each step within a transformer layer. Through empirical validation using a fully pretrained model, we show that the variance shrinkage effect still persists after extensive gradient updates.

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""The Troubling Emergence of Hallucination in Large Language Models - An Extensive Definition, Quantification, and Prescriptive Remediations""?","The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread acclaim for their remarkable emerging capabilities. However, the issue of hallucination has parallelly emerged as a by-product, posing significant concerns. While some recent endeavors have been made to identify and mitigate different types of hallucination, there has been a limited emphasis on the nuanced categorization of hallucination and associated mitigation methods. To address this gap, we offer a fine-grained discourse on profiling hallucination based on its degree, orientation, and category, along with offering strategies for alleviation. As such, we define two overarching orientations of hallucination: (i) factual mirage (FM) and (ii) silver lining (SL). To provide a more comprehensive understanding, both orientations are further sub-categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic, with three degrees of severity - (i) mild, (ii) moderate, and (iii) alarming. We also meticulously categorize hallucination into six types: (i) acronym ambiguity, (ii) numeric nuisance, (iii) generated golem, (iv) virtual voice, (v) geographic erratum, and (vi) time wrap. Furthermore, we curate HallucInation eLiciTation (HILT), a publicly available dataset comprising of 75,000 samples generated using 15 contemporary LLMs along with human annotations for the aforementioned categories. Finally, to establish a method for quantifying and to offer a comparative spectrum that allows us to evaluate and rank LLMs based on their vulnerability to producing hallucinations, we propose Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI). We firmly believe that HVI holds significant value as a tool for the wider NLP community, with the potential to serve as a rubric in AI-related policy-making. In conclusion, we propose two solution strategies for mitigating hallucinations."

However, audio recordings with high-quality text annotations can be difficult to acquire. In this work, we approach text-to-audio synthesis using unlabeled videos and pre-trained language-vision models. We propose to learn the desired text-audio correspondence by leveraging the visual modality as a bridge. We train a conditional diffusion model to generate the audio track of a video, given a video frame encoded by a pretrained contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. At test time, we first explore performing a zero-shot modality transfer and condition the diffusion model with a CLIP-encoded text query. However, we observe a noticeable performance drop with respect to image queries. To close this gap, we further adopt a pretrained diffusion prior model to generate a CLIP image embedding given a CLIP text embedding. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and that the pretrained diffusion prior can reduce the modality transfer gap. While we focus on text-to-audio synthesis, the proposed model can also generate audio from image queries, and it shows competitive performance against a state-of-the-art image-to-audio synthesis model in a subjective listening test. This study offers a new direction of approaching text-to-audio synthesis that leverages the naturally-occurring audio-visual correspondence in videos and the power of pretrained language-vision models."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Train Global, Tailor Local: Minimalist Multilingual Translation into Endangered Languages""?","In many humanitarian scenarios, translation into severely low resource languages often does not require a universal translation engine, but a dedicated text-specific translation engine. For example, healthcare records, hygienic procedures, government communication, emergency procedures and religious texts are all limited texts. While generic translation engines for all languages do not exist, translation of multilingually known limited texts into new, endangered languages may be possible and reduce human translation effort. We attempt to leverage translation resources from rich resource languages to efficiently produce best possible translation quality for well known texts, which is available in multiple languages, in a new, severely low resource language. We examine two approaches: 1.) best selection of seed sentences to jump start translations in a new language in view of best generalization to the remainder of a larger targeted text(s), and 2.) we adapt large general multilingual translation engines from many other languages to focus on a specific text in a new, unknown language. We find that adapting large pretrained multilingual models to the domain/text first and then to the severely low resource language works best. If we also select a best set of seed sentences, we can improve average chrF performance on new test languages from a baseline of 21.9 to 50.7, while reducing the number of seed sentences to only ∼1,000 in the new, unknown language."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Research on integrated coastal zone management from past to the future: a bibliometric analysis""?","Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) has been regarded as an effective tool for achieving sustainable development of coastal ecosystems and reducing potential human health risks, but questions remain regarding its research status and future directions. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis was conducted using screened 6151 publications collected from Web of Science Core Collection databases. An exponential increase trend of publications revealed the continuous and strong research interests for ICZM worldwide. The most high-yield country, institution, category, and journal were USA, NOAA, Environmental Sciences, and Ocean & Coastal Management, respectively. Regarding the number of publications, academic influence, and international collaboration, the developed countries occupied the predominant positions. Co-word analysis reveals eight important topics: challenge, service, management and planning, method and technology, development, process, area, and system. Relevant future directions of the ICZM field were proposed based on the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. This review addresses the question of what focal topics in the ICZM field and what should be focused on in future works by objective and quantitative methods. Our results provide valuable insights into the evolution of the ICZM field and the sustainable development of the coastal areas."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Understanding In-Context Learning via Supportive Pretraining Data""?","In-context learning (ICL) improves language models’ performance on a variety of NLP tasks by simply demonstrating a handful of examples at inference time. It is not well understood why ICL ability emerges, as the model has never been specifically trained on such demonstrations. Unlike prior work that explores implicit mechanisms behind ICL, we study ICL via investigating the pretraining data. Specifically, we first adapt an iterative, gradient-based approach to find a small subset of pretraining data that supports ICL. We observe that a continued pretraining on this small subset significantly improves the model’s ICL ability, by up to 18%. We then compare the supportive subset constrastively with random subsets of pretraining data and discover: (1) The supportive pretraining data to ICL do not have a higher domain relevance to downstream tasks. (2) The supportive pretraining data have a higher mass of rarely occurring, long-tail tokens. (3) The supportive pretraining data are challenging examples where the information gain from long-range context is below average, indicating learning to incorporate difficult long-range context encourages ICL. Our work takes a first step towards understanding ICL via analyzing instance-level pretraining data. Our insights have a potential to enhance the ICL ability of language models by actively guiding the construction of pretraining data in the future."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Federated Learning as Variational Inference: A Scalable Expectation Propagation Approach""?","The canonical formulation of federated learning treats it as a distributed optimization problem where the model parameters are optimized against a global loss function that decomposes across client loss functions. A recent alternative formulation instead treats federated learning as a distributed inference problem, where the goal is to infer a global posterior from partitioned client data (Al-Shedivat et al., 2021). This paper extends the inference view and describes a variational inference formulation of federated learning where the goal is to find a global variational posterior that well-approximates the true posterior. This naturally motivates an expectation propagation approach to federated learning (FedEP), where approximations to the global posterior are iteratively refined through probabilistic message-passing between the central server and the clients. We conduct an extensive empirical study across various algorithmic considerations and describe practical strategies for scaling up expectation propagation to the modern federated setting. We apply FedEP on standard federated learning benchmarks and find that it outperforms strong baselines in terms of both convergence speed and accuracy."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Text Matching Improves Sequential Recommendation by Reducing Popularity Biases""?","This paper proposes Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommenda-tion model (TASTE), which maps items and users in an embedding space and recommends items by matching their text representations. TASTE verbalizes items and user-item interactions using identifiers and attributes of items. To better characterize user behaviors, TASTE additionally proposes an attention sparsity method, which enables TASTE to model longer user-item interactions by reducing the self-attention computations during encoding. Our experiments show that TASTE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on widely used sequential recommendation datasets. TASTE alleviates the cold start problem by representing long-tail items using full-text modeling and bringing the benefits of pretrained language models to recommendation systems. Our further analyses illustrate that TASTE significantly improves the recommendation accuracy by reducing the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models and returning more appropriate and text-relevant items to satisfy users. All codes are available at https://github.com/OpenMatch/TASTE."

The key sub-detector of DAMPE is the Bismuth Germanium Oxide (BGO) Electromagnetic CALorimeter (ECAL), which measures the energies of electrons/gamma-rays ranging from 5 GeV - 10 TeV. A laser test carried out to study the response of the BGO ECAL to up to ∼ TeV energy deposition revealed that the BGO ﬂuorescence response retains linearity at laser energy deposition densities higher than that induced by a ∼ 10 TeV electromagnetic shower. The energy measurements obtained from on-orbit data were also compared with Monte Carlo simulation results. The present study conﬁrms that there is no ﬂuorescence quenching eﬀect in the DAMPE BGO ECAL."

"Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled ""Understanding Masked Autoencoders via Hierarchical Latent Variable Models""?","Masked autoencoder (MAE), a simple and effective self-supervised learning framework based on the reconstruction of masked image regions, has recently achieved prominent success in a variety of vision tasks. Despite the emergence of intriguing empirical observations on MAE, a theoretically principled understanding is still lacking. In this work, we formally characterize and justify existing empirical in-sights and provide theoretical guarantees of MAE. We formulate the underlying data-generating process as a hierarchical latent variable model, and show that under reasonable assumptions, MAE provably identifies a set of latent variables in the hierarchical model, explaining why MAE can extract high-level information from pixels. Further, we show how key hyperparameters in MAE (the masking ratio and the patch size) determine which true latent variables to be recovered, therefore influencing the level of semantic information in the representation. Specifically, extremely large or small masking ratios inevitably lead to low-level representations. Our theory offers coherent explanations of existing empirical observations and provides insights for potential empirical improvements and fundamental limitations of the masked-reconstruction paradigm. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical insights."

However, defects and trap sites are inevitably generated on the surface and at the grain boundaries of the perovskite layer. Here, we report a convenient method for preparing dense and uniform perovskite films, employing g-C3N4 quantum dots doped into the perovskite layer by regulating proper proportions. This process produces perovskite films with dense microstructures and flat surfaces. As a result, the higher fill factor (0.78) and a power conversion efficiency of 20.02% are obtained by the defect passivation of g-C3N4QDs."
