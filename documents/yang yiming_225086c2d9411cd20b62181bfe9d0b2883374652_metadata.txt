Tldr: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'It is shown that Doc2α-deficient mice have neuronal morphological abnormalities and defects in neural activity, and it is demonstrated that SCGN functions in social/repetitive behaviors, glutamate release, and neuronal morphology of the mice through its Doc2 α-interacting activity, likely contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders through its interaction with SCGN.'}
