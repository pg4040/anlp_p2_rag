Research
My research interests include information integration and machine learning, particularly information extraction, text categorization and learning from large datasets. I have a longstanding interest in statistical relational learning and learning models, or learning from data that display non-trivial structure.
Projects I'm currently involved with include NELL, a large-scale information extraction system (which uses SEAL, as well as other techniques); and ProPPR, a locally groundable probabilistic first-order logic.
