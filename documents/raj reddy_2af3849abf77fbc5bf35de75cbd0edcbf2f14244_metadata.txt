Title: Anti Inflammatory activity of AgNps synthesized using flower formulation (Rosa andJasminum
Year: 2023
Abstract: Introduction: In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the use of traditional medicinal herbs, and as a result, 
pharmaceutical companies are investing heavily in developing natural medications derived from plants. Nanoparticles act 
in a number of potential ways and fields. Chemical synthesis of nanoparticles is no longer advantageous compared to 
plant-based synthesis. The current study uses a green method to create silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) utilizing flower 
extract.
Materials and methods: The anti-inflammatory activity for gel was tested by the following convention proposed by 
Muzushima and Kabayashi with specific alterations. 0.05 mL of Rosa and jasminum jel of various fixations.
Result: Using rosa and jasminum extract in the manufacture of silver nanoparticles, the nanoparticles showed remarkable 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. It was discovered that the cytotoxic effect was less harmful, demonstrating 
biocompatibility. Rosa jasminum extract of AgNps showed good anti-inflammatory efficacy in the EA and BSA assays.
Conclusion: From our study we concluded that Silver nanoparticles were created using rosa and jasminum extract, and 
the nanoparticles displayed impressive anti-inflammatory.
