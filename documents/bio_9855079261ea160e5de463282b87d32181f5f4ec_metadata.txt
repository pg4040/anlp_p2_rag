Title: Dispensing of Antibiotics Without Prescription in Southern Benin, West Africa, 2018
Year: 2023
Abstract: The over-the-counter sale of antibiotics is recognized as a basis for antibiotic abuse and thus represents a global threat. This study aimed to determine the frequency of dispensing of certain antibiotics without prescription in the city of Cotonou. This was a cross-sectional study with descriptive and analytical aims. Data were collected in randomly selected pharmacies in Cotonou. A pseudo client visited some pharmacies to request the delivery of certain antibiotics and clinical scenarios were simulated to assess the attitudes and practices of professionals. Investigative staff visited 55 pharmacies and requested either amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin or ceftriaxone without providing a prescription or any other justification for the request. The frequencies of antibiotics dispensed without prescription during the visit of the pseudo-client were Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid cp (100%), Gentamycin 80 mg inj (60%), Ciprofloxacin 500 mg cp (72, 73%), and Ceftriaxone 1 g inj (58,18%). In the diarrhea scenario, only 4% of the pharmacies visited offered oral rehydration. For the bronchopulmonary clinical case, the most proposed antibiotics were: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (50%), Amoxicillin (28.57%) and Azithromycin (21.43%). The dispensing of antibiotics without prescription in pharmacies is high. There is an urgent need for regulatory measures and public awareness to limit this practice. This research work has been published in EC Pharmacology And Toxicology (2022).
