Title: Gonadotropin Receptor Cross-Talk and Altered Functions in Gonadal and Non-Gonadal Tissues
Year: 2023
Abstract: Reproduction depends on the responses of gonadotropins through their specific receptors. The gonadotropin family has three members; Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). These glycoprotein hormones comprise two subunits, an identical α-subunit and a hormone-specific-β subunit. Their cognate receptors (FSHR and LHCGR) are two adrenergic receptor-like family A/rhodopsin-like G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) with structurally distinct ligand binding domains. The hCG binds to LHCGR but has a longer half-life and higher affinity to LHCGR. 
Document 1: The hCG binds to LHCGR but has a longer half-life and higher affinity to LHCGR. The expression of FSHR and LHCGR is observed in both gonadal and nongonadal cells. In this review, we will be emphasizing the differential expression of gonadotropin receptors in different cells of the human body, their specific responses through cross-talk, and how a defect in the expression and activity of FSHR and LHCGR may alter the responses of FSH and LH/hCG leading to diseases like PCOS, cancer and metabolic disorders.

Title: Extracting Training Data from Diffusion Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: Image diffusion models such as DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion have attracted significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality synthetic images. In this work, we show that diffusion models memorize individual images from their training data and emit them at generation time. With a generate-and-filter pipeline, we extract over a thousand training examples from state-of-the-art models, ranging from photographs of individual people to trademarked company logos. We also train hundreds of diffusion models in various settings to analyze how different modeling and data decisions affect privacy. Overall, our results show that diffusion models are much less private than prior generative models such as GANs, and that mitigating these vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training.

Title: VSC-HVDC transmission line fault location based on transient characteristics
Year: 2023
Abstract: Accurate and reliable fault location is necessary for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the VSC-HVDC transmission system. This paper proposed a single-terminal fault location method based on the fault transient characteristics of the two-terminal VSCHVDC transmission system. The pole-to-pole transient fault process was divided into three stages, the time-domain expression of the DC current during the diode freewheel stage was used to locate the fault point, and a criterion for judging whether the fault evolves to the diode freewheel stage was proposed. Taking into account the enhancing effect of the opposite system to the fault current, theDC side pole-to-ground fault networkwas equated to a fourth-order circuit model, the relationship of fault distance with the characteristic roots of fault current differential equationwas derived, and the Prony algorithmwas utilized for datafitting to extract characteristic roots to realize fault location. 
Document 1: A two-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system was modelled in PSCAD/EMTDC. The simulation result verifies that the proposed principle can accurately locate the fault point on the VSC-HVDC transmission lines.

Title: Squeeze, Recover and Relabel: Dataset Condensation at ImageNet Scale From A New Perspective
Year: 2023
Abstract: We present a new dataset condensation framework termed Squeeze, Recover and Relabel (SRe$^2$L) that decouples the bilevel optimization of model and synthetic data during training, to handle varying scales of datasets, model architectures and image resolutions for efficient dataset condensation. The proposed method demonstrates flexibility across diverse dataset scales and exhibits multiple advantages in terms of arbitrary resolutions of synthesized images, low training cost and memory consumption with high-resolution synthesis, and the ability to scale up to arbitrary evaluation network architectures. Extensive experiments are conducted on Tiny-ImageNet and full ImageNet-1K datasets. Under 50 IPC, our approach achieves the highest 42.5% and 60.8% validation accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K, outperforming all previous state-of-the-art methods by margins of 14.5% and 32.9%, respectively.

Title: PESCO: Prompt-enhanced Self Contrastive Learning for Zero-shot Text Classification
Year: 2023
Abstract: We present PESCO, a novel contrastive learning framework that substantially improves the performance of zero-shot text classification. We formulate text classification as a neural text retrieval problem where each document is treated as a query, and the system learns the mapping from each query to the relevant class labels by (1) adding prompts to enhance label retrieval, and (2) using retrieved labels to enrich the training set in a self-training loop of contrastive learning. PESCO achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text classification datasets. On DBpedia, we achieve 98.5% accuracy without any labeled data, which is close to the fully-supervised result. Extensive experiments and analyses show all the components of PESCO are necessary for improving the performance of zero-shot text classification.

Title: Are aligned neural networks adversarially aligned?
Year: 2023
Abstract: Large language models are now tuned to align with the goals of their creators, namely to be""helpful and harmless.""These models should respond helpfully to user questions, but refuse to answer requests that could cause harm. However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study to what extent these models remain aligned, even when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs.

Title: Continually learning new languages
Year: 2023
Abstract: Multilingual speech recognition with neural networks is often implemented with batch-learning, when all of the languages are available before training. An ability to add new languages after the prior training sessions can be economically bene-ﬁcial, but the main challenge is catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we combine the qualities of weight factorization, transfer learning and Elastic Weight Consolidation in order to counter catastrophic forgetting and facilitate learning new languages quickly. Such combination allowed us to eliminate catastrophic forgetting while still achieving performance for the new languages comparable with having all languages at once, in experiments of learning from an initial 10 languages to achieve 27 languages.

Title: Time‐resolved SWIR imaging for the assessment of the activity of occlusal caries lesions
Year: 2023
Abstract: The aim of this study was to develop a clinical SWIR reflectance handpiece to assess the activity of lesions on the occlusal surfaces. The time‐resolved reflectivity of 10 active and 10 arrested occlusal caries lesions on extracted teeth was monitored at 1470 nm using a benchtop system and a modified clinical prototype during forced air drying. The presence of a highly mineralized surface layer measured with microcomputed tomography (microCT) was used to indicate lesion activity. Multiple kinetic parameters were extracted from the acquired SWIR time versus intensity dehydration curves and used to assess lesion activity. Three parameters: delay, %Ifin, and rate calculated from the SWIR dehydration curves were significantly different (p < 0.05) between active and arrested lesions.

Title: Principle-Driven Self-Alignment of Language Models from Scratch with Minimal Human Supervision
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent AI-assistant agents, such as ChatGPT, predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human annotations and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align the output of large language models (LLMs) with human intentions, ensuring they are helpful, ethical, and reliable. However, this dependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant agents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related issues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power of LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. 
Document 1: Applying SELF-ALIGN to the LLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary. With fewer than 300 lines of human annotations (including<200 seed prompts, 16 generic principles, and 5 exemplars for in-context learning). Dromedary significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including Text-Davinci-003 and Alpaca, on benchmark datasets with various settings.

Title: Memory-adaptive Depth-wise Heterogenous Federated Learning
Year: 2023
Abstract: Federated learning is a promising paradigm that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing the local data. However, the presence of heterogeneous devices in federated learning, such as mobile phones and IoT devices with varying memory capabilities, would limit the scale and hence the performance of the model could be trained. The mainstream approaches to address memory limitations focus on width-slimming techniques, where different clients train subnetworks with reduced widths locally and then the server aggregates the subnetworks. The global model produced from these methods suffers from performance degradation due to the negative impact of the actions taken to handle the varying subnetwork widths in the aggregation phase. In this paper, we introduce a memory-adaptive depth-wise learning solution in FL called FeDepth, which adaptively decomposes the full model into blocks according to the memory budgets of each client and trains blocks sequentially to obtain a full inference model. 
Document 1: In this paper, we introduce a memory-adaptive depth-wise learning solution in FL called FeDepth, which adaptively decomposes the full model into blocks according to the memory budgets of each client and trains blocks sequentially to obtain a full inference model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 5% and more than 10% improvements in top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of depth-wise fine-tuning on ViT. Our findings highlight the importance of memory-aware techniques for federated learning with heterogeneous devices and the success of depth-wise training strategy in improving the global model's performance.

Title: WebUI: A Dataset for Enhancing Visual UI Understanding with Web Semantics
Year: 2023
Abstract: Modeling user interfaces (UIs) from visual information allows systems to make inferences about the functionality and semantics needed to support use cases in accessibility, app automation, and testing. Current datasets for training machine learning models are limited in size due to the costly and time-consuming process of manually collecting and annotating UIs. We crawled the web to construct WebUI, a large dataset of 400,000 rendered web pages associated with automatically extracted metadata. We analyze the composition of WebUI and show that while automatically extracted data is noisy, most examples meet basic criteria for visual UI modeling. We applied several strategies for incorporating semantics found in web pages to increase the performance of visual UI understanding models in the mobile domain, where less labeled data is available: (i) element detection, (ii) screen classification and (iii) screen similarity.

Title: Understanding Masked Autoencoders via Hierarchical Latent Variable Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: Masked autoencoder (MAE), a simple and effective self-supervised learning framework based on the reconstruction of masked image regions, has recently achieved prominent success in a variety of vision tasks. Despite the emergence of intriguing empirical observations on MAE, a theoretically principled understanding is still lacking. In this work, we formally characterize and justify existing empirical in-sights and provide theoretical guarantees of MAE. We formulate the underlying data-generating process as a hierarchical latent variable model, and show that under reasonable assumptions, MAE provably identifies a set of latent variables in the hierarchical model, explaining why MAE can extract high-level information from pixels. Further, we show how key hyperparameters in MAE (the masking ratio and the patch size) determine which true latent variables to be recovered, therefore influencing the level of semantic information in the representation.

Title: Score: A Rule Engine for the Scone Knowledge Base System
Year: 2023
Abstract: We present Score, a rule engine designed and implemented for the Scone knowledge base system. Scone is a knowledge base system designed for storing and manipulating rich representations of general knowledge in symbolic form. It represents knowledge in the form of nodes and links in a network structure, and it can perform basic inference about the relationships between different elements efficiently. On its own, Scone acts as a sort of""smart memory""that can interface with other software systems. One area of improvement for Scone is how useful it can be in supplying knowledge to an intelligent agent that can use the knowledge to perform actions and update the knowledge base with its observations. We augment the Scone system with a production rule engine that automatically performs simple inference based on existing and newly-added structures in Scone's knowledge base, potentially improving the capabilities of any planning systems built on top of Scone.

Title: Zero-shot Transfer of Article-aware Legal Outcome Classification for European Court of Human Rights Cases
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this paper, we cast Legal Judgment Prediction on European Court of Human Rights cases into an article-aware classification task, where the case outcome is classified from a combined input of case facts and convention articles. This configuration facilitates the model learning some legal reasoning ability in mapping article text to specific case fact text. It also provides an opportunity to evaluate the model’s ability to generalize to zero-shot settings when asked to classify the case outcome with respect to articles not seen during training. We devise zero-shot experiments and apply domain adaptation methods based on domain discrimination and Wasserstein distance. Our results demonstrate that the article-aware architecture outperforms straightforward fact classification. We also find that domain adaptation methods improve zero-shot transfer performance, with article relatedness and encoder pre-training influencing the effect.

Title: The Relationship between the Serum NLRP1 Level and Coronary Lesions in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease
Year: 2023
Abstract: Background The pathogenesis of coronary artery disease is complex, and inflammation is one of the regulatory factors. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1) plays an important role in the cellular inflammatory response, cell apoptosis, cell death, and autoimmune diseases. Whether the level of NLRP1 is related to the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been reported. Objective To test the serum level of NLRP1 in unstable angina (UA) patients and investigate the effect of NLRP1 on coronary stenosis severity of the coronary artery disease (CAD). 
Document 1: Serum NLRP1 levels were significantly different among different subgroups. The patient's Gensini score was correlated with the patient's serum NLRP1 level. Conclusion The serum NLRP1 level is increased in patients with UA, which is increased with the increasing severity of coronary lesions.

Title: Do Privacy Labels Answer Users' Privacy Questions?
Year: 2023
Abstract: —Inspired by earlier academic research, iOS app privacy labels and the recent Google Play data safety labels have been introduced as a way to systematically present users with concise summaries of an app’s data practices. Yet, little research has been conducted to determine how well today’s mobile app privacy labels address people’s actual privacy concerns or questions. We analyze a crowd-sourced corpus of privacy questions collected from mobile app users to determine to what extent these mobile app labels actually address users’ privacy concerns and questions. While there are differences between iOS labels and Google Play labels, our results indicate that an important percentage of people’s privacy questions are not answered or only partially addressed in today’s labels.

Title: Completing Visual Objects via Bridging Generation and Segmentation
Year: 2023
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to object completion, with the primary goal of reconstructing a complete object from its partially visible components. Our method, named MaskComp, delineates the completion process through iterative stages of generation and segmentation. In each iteration, the object mask is provided as an additional condition to boost image generation, and, in return, the generated images can lead to a more accurate mask by fusing the segmentation of images. We demonstrate that the combination of one generation and one segmentation stage effectively functions as a mask denoiser. Through alternation between the generation and segmentation stages, the partial object mask is progressively refined, providing precise shape guidance and yielding superior object completion results. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over existing approaches, e.g., ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, establishing it as an effective solution for object completion.

Year: 2023
Abstract: In order to assess the degree to which China’s poverty alleviation resettlement (PAR) has been able to address the development conundrum of natural resources reliance and human welfare, it was necessary to investigate the effects of PAR on rural households with regard to their dependence on natural resources. This article evaluated households’ natural resources dependence in rural China by constructing a natural resources dependence index and empirically analyzing the effect of PAR on households by using household survey data from Ankang Prefecture, located in southern Shaanxi Province. The findings demonstrated that PAR could effectively decrease the dependence of households on local natural resources, thus safeguarding the natural environment. Moreover, there were noteworthy distinctions regarding households’ natural resources dependence.

Title: FREDOM: Fairness Domain Adaptation Approach to Semantic Scene Understanding
Year: 2023
Abstract: Although Domain Adaptation in Semantic Scene Segmentation has shown impressive improvement in recent years, the fairness concerns in the domain adaptation have yet to be well defined and addressed. In addition, fairness is one of the most critical aspects when deploying the segmentation models into human-related real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving, as any unfair predictions could influence human safety. In this paper, we propose a novel Fairness Domain Adaptation (FREDOM) approach to semantic scene segmentation. In particular, from the proposed formulated fairness objective, a new adaptation framework will be introduced based on the fair treatment of class distributions. Moreover, to generally model the context of structural dependency, a new conditional structural constraint is introduced to impose the consistency of predicted segmentation. Thanks to the proposed Conditional Structure Network, the self-attention mechanism has sufficiently modeled the structural information of segmentation.

Through the ablation studies, the proposed method has shown the performance improvement of the segmentation models and promoted fairness in the model predictions. The experimental results on the two standard benchmarks, i.e., SYNTHIA $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes and GTA5 $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes, have shown that our method achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance11The implementation of FREDOM is available at https://github.com/uark-cviu/FREDOM

Title: Accelerating Diffusion-based Combinatorial Optimization Solvers by Progressive Distillation
Year: 2023
Abstract: Graph-based diffusion models have shown promising results in terms of generating high-quality solutions to NP-complete (NPC) combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. However, those models are often inefficient in inference, due to the iterative evaluation nature of the denoising diffusion process. This paper proposes to use progressive distillation to speed up the inference by taking fewer steps (e.g., forecasting two steps ahead within a single step) during the denoising process. Our experimental results show that the progressively distilled model can perform inference 16 times faster with only 0.019% degradation in performance on the TSP-50 dataset.

Year: 2023
Abstract: Neural network-based Combinatorial Optimization (CO) methods have shown promising results in solving various NP-complete (NPC) problems without relying on hand-crafted domain knowledge. This paper broadens the current scope of neural solvers for NPC problems by introducing a new graph-based diffusion framework, namely DIFUSCO. Our framework casts NPC problems as discrete {0, 1}-vector optimization problems and leverages graph-based denoising diffusion models to generate high-quality solutions. We investigate two types of diffusion models with Gaussian and Bernoulli noise, respectively, and devise an effective inference schedule to enhance the solution quality. We evaluate our methods on two well-studied NPC combinatorial optimization problems: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS).

Title: Evaluating Picture Description Speech for Dementia Detection using Image-text Alignment
Year: 2023
Abstract: Using picture description speech for dementia detection has been studied for 30 years. Despite the long history, previous models focus on identifying the differences in speech patterns between healthy subjects and patients with dementia but do not utilize the picture information directly. In this paper, we propose the first dementia detection models that take both the picture and the description texts as inputs and incorporate knowledge from large pre-trained image-text alignment models. We observe the difference between dementia and healthy samples in terms of the text's relevance to the picture and the focused area of the picture. We thus consider such a difference could be used to enhance dementia detection accuracy. Specifically, we use the text's relevance to the picture to rank and filter the sentences of the samples. We also identified focused areas of the picture as topics and categorized the sentences according to the focused areas.

Title: SALMON: Self-Alignment with Principle-Following Reward Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on response demonstrations combined with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) constitutes a powerful paradigm for aligning LLM-based AI agents. However, a significant limitation of such an approach is its dependency on high-quality human annotations, making its application to intricate tasks challenging due to difficulties in obtaining consistent response demonstrations and in-distribution response preferences. This paper presents a novel approach, namely SALMON (Self-ALignMent with principle-fOllowiNg reward models), to align base language models with minimal human supervision, using only a small set of human-defined principles, yet achieving superior performance. Central to our approach is a principle-following reward model. Trained on synthetic preference data, this model can generate reward scores based on arbitrary human-defined principles.

Title: LightSeq: Sequence Level Parallelism for Distributed Training of Long Context Transformers
Year: 2023
Abstract: Increasing the context length of large language models (LLMs) unlocks fundamentally new capabilities, but also significantly increases the memory footprints of training. Previous model-parallel systems such as Megatron-LM partition and compute different attention heads in parallel, resulting in large communication volumes, so they cannot scale beyond the number of attention heads, thereby hindering its adoption. In this paper, we introduce a new approach, LightSeq, for long-context LLMs training. LightSeq has many notable advantages. First, LightSeq partitions over the sequence dimension, hence is agnostic to model architectures and readily applicable for models with varying numbers of attention heads, such as Multi-Head, Multi-Query and Grouped-Query attention. Second, LightSeq not only requires up to 4.7x less communication than Megatron-LM on popular LLMs but also overlaps the communication with computation.

Title: One-for-All: Generalized LoRA for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning
Year: 2023
Abstract: We present Generalized LoRA (GLoRA), an advanced approach for universal parameter-efficient fine-tuning tasks. Enhancing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), GLoRA employs a generalized prompt module to optimize pre-trained model weights and adjust intermediate activations, providing more flexibility and capability across diverse tasks and datasets. Moreover, GLoRA facilitates efficient parameter adaptation by employing a scalable, modular, layer-wise structure search that learns individual adapter of each layer. Originating from a unified mathematical formulation, GLoRA exhibits strong transfer learning, few-shot learning and domain generalization abilities, as it adapts to new tasks through not only weights but also additional dimensions like activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GLoRA outperforms all previous methods in natural, specialized, and structured vision benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy with fewer parameters and computations.

Year: 2023
Abstract: To evaluate the impact of a two-dose VarV program on varicella incidence among the whole population, considering the influence of public health and social measures (PHSMs), we extracted surveillance data on varicella cases during 2013–2022 in Minhang, Shanghai. Then, we estimated the incidence trend of varicella through interrupted time-series analyses and quantified the impact of the immunization program and PHSMs using Serfling regression. We also explored the associations between PHSMs and varicella cases. The implementation of the two-dose VarV strategy was followed by a significant decrease in varicella incidence (−1.84% per month).

Title: MultiViz: Towards User-Centric Visualizations and Interpretations of Multimodal Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: The nature of human and computer interactions are inherently multimodal, which has led to substantial interest in building interpretable, interactive, and reliable multimodal interfaces. However, modern multimodal models and interfaces are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it challenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize their internal workings in order to empower stakeholders to visualize model behavior, perform model debugging, and promote trust in these models? Our paper proposes MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of multimodal models via 4 stages: (1) unimodal importance, (2) cross-modal interactions, (3) multimodal representations and (4) multimodal prediction. MultiViz includes modular visualization tools for each stage before combining outputs from all stages through an interactive and human-in-the-loop API.

Title: Completing Visual Objects via Bridging Generation and Segmentation
Year: 2023
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to object completion, with the primary goal of reconstructing a complete object from its partially visible components. Our method, named MaskComp, delineates the completion process through iterative stages of generation and segmentation. In each iteration, the object mask is provided as an additional condition to boost image generation, and, in return, the generated images can lead to a more accurate mask by fusing the segmentation of images. We demonstrate that the combination of one generation and one segmentation stage effectively functions as a mask denoiser. Through alternation between the generation and segmentation stages, the partial object mask is progressively refined, providing precise shape guidance and yielding superior object completion results. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over existing approaches, e.g., ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, establishing it as an effective solution for object completion.

Title: Jointly modeling products and resource pages for task-oriented recommendation
Year: 2023
Abstract: Modeling high-level user intent in recommender systems can improve performance, although it is often difficult to obtain a ground truth measure of this intent. In this paper, we investigate a novel way to obtain such an intent signal by leveraging resource pages associated with a particular task. We jointly model product interactions and resource page interactions to create a system which can recommend both products and resource pages to users. Our experiments consider the domain of home improvement product recommendation, where resource pages are DIY (do-it-yourself) project pages from Lowes.com. Each DIY page provides a list of tools, materials, and step-by-step instructions to complete a DIY project, such as building a deck, installing cabinets, and fixing a leaking pipe. We use this data as an indicator of the intended project, which is a natural high-level intent signal for home improvement shoppers.

Title: Exploratory Analysis of Objective Outcome Measures for the Clinical Assessment of Erosive Tooth Wear
Year: 2023
Abstract: This study proposed using enamel surface texture and thickness for the objective detection and monitoring of erosive tooth wear (ETW), comparing them to the standard subjective Basic Erosive Wear Evaluation (BEWE). Thirty-two subjects (n = 597 teeth) were enrolled in this longitudinal observational clinical study. Enamel thickness (by cross-polarization optical coherence tomography, CP-OCT) and 3D dental microwear parameters, i.e., area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc), anisotropy (Str), and roughness (Sa) (by white-light scanning confocal profilometry), were obtained from buccal surfaces. Buccal, occlusal, and lingual surfaces were scored for BEWE and the maximum score per tooth (BEWEMax) was determined at baseline and 12 months (M12). Data outcome relationships were evaluated (alpha = 0.05).

Title: Effective Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Control with Relative Entropy Regularization
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this paper, a novel Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach, Multi-Agent Continuous Dynamic Policy Gradient (MACDPP) was proposed to tackle the issues of limited capability and sample efficiency in various scenarios controlled by multiple agents. It alleviates the inconsistency of multiple agents' policy updates by introducing the relative entropy regularization to the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework with the Actor-Critic (AC) structure. Evaluated by multi-agent cooperation and competition tasks and traditional control tasks including OpenAI benchmarks and robot arm manipulation, MACDPP demonstrates significant superiority in learning capability and sample efficiency compared with both related multi-agent and widely implemented signal-agent baselines and therefore expands the potential of MARL in effectively learning challenging control scenarios.

Title: A Via-Less Fully Screen-Printed Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for 5G Millimeter Wave Communication
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a via-less fully screen-printed reconfigurable intelligent surface which can establish a second line-of-sight communication from 23.5GHz to 29.5GHz. By serially connecting the H shaped resonator along the H field of the incident wave, we minimize the effect of the biasing lines and make a via-less design, which reduces the fabrication difficulty and cost. The unit-cell simulation of the array with screen-printed VO2 switches shows a 215° to 160° phase shift difference between the ON and OFF states within bandwidth. During the field testing of the ideal arrays, we verify that the array can redirect the 45° incident wave to 0° reflection with a signal enhancement of at least 10 dB as compared to the array which has all unit cells in the OFF condition.

Title: Combining Spatiotemporally Global and Local Interpolations Improves Modeling of Annual Land Surface Temperature Cycles
Year: 2023
Abstract: Annual temperature cycle (ATC) models are widely used to characterize temporally continuous land surface temperature (LST) dynamics within an annual cycle. However, the existing ATC models ignore the spatiotemporally local correlations among adjacent LST pixels and are inadequate for capturing the complex relationships between LSTs and LST-related descriptors. To address these issues, we propose an improved ATC model (termed the ATC_GL), which combines both the spatiotemporally global and local interpolations. Using the random forest (RF) algorithm, the ATC_GL model quantifies the complex relationships between LSTs and LST-related descriptors such as the surface air temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, and digital elevation model. The performances of the ATC_GL and several extensively used LST reconstruction methods were compared under both clear-sky and overcast conditions.

Title: Value Kaleidoscope: Engaging AI with Pluralistic Human Values, Rights, and Duties
Year: 2023
Abstract: Human values are crucial to human decision-making. Value pluralism is the view that multiple correct values may be held in tension with one another (e.g., when considering lying to a friend to protect their feelings, how does one balance honesty with friendship?). As statistical learners, AI systems fit to averages by default, washing out these potentially irreducible value conflicts. To improve AI systems to better reflect value pluralism, the first-order challenge is to explore the extent to which AI systems can model pluralistic human values, rights, and duties as well as their interaction. We introduce ValuePrism, a large-scale dataset of 218k values, rights, and duties connected to 31k human-written situations. ValuePrism's contextualized values are generated by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91% of the time.

ValuePrism's contextualized values are generated by GPT-4 and deemed high-quality by human annotators 91% of the time. We conduct a large-scale study with annotators across diverse social and demographic backgrounds to try to understand whose values are represented. With ValuePrism, we build Kaleido, an open, light-weight, and structured language-based multi-task model that generates, explains, and assesses the relevance and valence (i.e., support or oppose) of human values, rights, and duties within a specific context. Humans prefer the sets of values output by our system over the teacher GPT-4, finding them more accurate and with broader coverage. In addition, we demonstrate that Kaleido can help explain variability in human decision-making by outputting contrasting values. Finally, we show that Kaleido's representations transfer to other philosophical frameworks and datasets, confirming the benefit of an explicit, modular, and interpretable approach to value pluralism.

Title: Fusing Models with Complementary Expertise
Year: 2023
Abstract: Training AI models that generalize across tasks and domains has long been among the open problems driving AI research. The emergence of Foundation Models made it easier to obtain expert models for a given task, but the heterogeneity of data that may be encountered at test time often means that any single expert is insufficient. We consider the Fusion of Experts (FoE) problem of fusing outputs of expert models with complementary knowledge of the data distribution and formulate it as an instance of supervised learning. Our method is applicable to both discriminative and generative tasks and leads to significant performance improvements in image and text classification, text summarization, multiple-choice QA, and automatic evaluation of generated text. We also extend our method to the""frugal""setting where it is desired to reduce the number of expert model evaluations at test time.

Title: Comparison of the structures and topologies of plasma extracted circulating nuclear and mitochondrial cell-free DNA
Year: 2023
Abstract: Introduction: The function, origin and structural features of circulating nuclear DNA (cir-nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (cir-mtDNA) are poorly known, even though they have been investigated in numerous clinical studies, and are involved in a number of routine clinical applications. Based on our previous report disproving the conventional plasma isolation used for cirDNA analysis, this work enables a direct topological comparison of the circulating structures associated with nuclear DNA and mitochondrial cell-free DNA. Materials and methods: We used a Q-PCR and low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) combination approach of cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA, extracted using a procedure that eliminates platelet activation during the plasma isolation process to prevent mitochondria release in the extracellular milieu. Various physical procedures, such as filtration and differential centrifugation, were employed to infer their circulating structures.

Title: Hyperbolic vs Euclidean Embeddings in Few-Shot Learning: Two Sides of the Same Coin
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent research in representation learning has shown that hierarchical data lends itself to low-dimensional and highly informative representations in hyperbolic space. However, even if hyperbolic embeddings have gathered attention in image recognition, their optimization is prone to numerical hurdles. Further, it remains unclear which applications stand to benefit the most from the implicit bias imposed by hyperbolicity, when compared to traditional Euclidean features. In this paper, we focus on prototypical hyperbolic neural networks. In particular, the tendency of hyperbolic embeddings to converge to the boundary of the Poincar\'e ball in high dimensions and the effect this has on few-shot classification. We show that the best few-shot results are attained for hyperbolic embeddings at a common hyperbolic radius.

Title: KALE: Using a K-Sparse Projector for Lexical Expansion
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent research has proposed retrieval approaches based on sparse representations and inverted indexes, with terms produced by neural language models and leveraging the advantages from both neural retrieval and lexical matching. This paper proposes KALE, a new lightweight method of this family that uses a small model with a k-sparse projector to convert dense representations into a sparse set of entries from a latent vocabulary. The KALE vocabulary captures semantic concepts than perform well when used in isolation, and perform better when extending the original lexical vocabulary, this way improving first-stage retrieval accuracy. Experiments with the MSMARCOv1 passage retrieval dataset, the TREC Deep Learning dataset, and BEIR datasets, examined the effectiveness of KALE under varying conditions. Results show that the KALE terms can replace the original lexical vocabulary, with gains in accuracy and efficiency.

Title: A Bibliometric Analysis on Cooperatives in Circular Economy and Eco-Innovation Studies
Year: 2023
Abstract: Cooperatives address societal challenges embracing values beyond mere profit-oriented production. Considering the ongoing shift to achieve efficient use of resources and increased circularity, cooperatives should be better equipped to incorporate circular economy (CE) and eco-innovation (EI) into their strategies (compared to regular enterprises). This paper reviews the scholarly literature focusing on the application of CE and EI within cooperative studies with the aim to understand the relationships between these topics, identify the existing scholarly communities, and to observe salient research themes. This study refined the method of van den Hoven and Rubalcaba (2016) to conduct a two-step bibliographic review of documents: a thematic analysis of citation data from Scopus (including a manual review of 16 papers) was followed by a bibliometric analysis of 101 documents from Web of Science (using R-Studio’s Biblioshiny).

Title: Fibrous calcite veins record stepwise, asymmetric opening and episodic hydrocarbon expulsion from organic-rich shales
Year: 2023
Abstract: Episodic fluid expulsion through fractures is widely expected during hydrocarbon generation, yet direct evidence for this process is lacking in the case of organic-rich shales. We investigated the formation of antitaxial, bed-parallel fibrous calcite veins hosted in organic-rich shales of the Eocene Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China. Our results from detailed, in situ geochemical traverses show that while some symmetric veins exhibit broadly synchronous and steady-state opening, other asymmetric veins consist of two geochemically distinct generations of calcite to either side of the median zone, suggesting asymmetric and asynchronous growth in two discrete episodes during hydrocarbon expulsion. Thus, we argue that each asymmetric vein recording two stages of opening implies that hydrocarbons were expelled from shales episodically.

Title: Multi-Objective Improvement of Android Applications
Year: 2023
Abstract: Non-functional properties, such as runtime or memory use, are important to mobile app users and developers, as they affect user experience. Previous work on automated improvement of non-functional properties in mobile apps failed to address the inherent trade-offs between such properties. We propose a practical approach and the first open-source tool, GIDroid (2023), for multi-objective automated improvement of Android apps. In particular, we use Genetic improvement, a search-based technique that navigates the space of software variants to find improved software. We use a simulation-based testing framework to greatly improve the speed of search. GIDroid contains three state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, and two new mutation operators, which cache the results of method calls. Genetic improvement relies on testing to validate patches. Previous work showed that tests in open-source Android applications are scarce. We thus wrote tests for 21 versions of 7 Android apps, creating a new benchmark for performance improvements.

Title: Importance of negative sampling in weak label learning
Year: 2023
Abstract: Weak-label learning is a challenging task that requires learning from data""bags""containing positive and negative instances, but only the bag labels are known. The pool of negative instances is usually larger than positive instances, thus making selecting the most informative negative instance critical for performance. Such a selection strategy for negative instances from each bag is an open problem that has not been well studied for weak-label learning. In this paper, we study several sampling strategies that can measure the usefulness of negative instances for weak-label learning and select them accordingly. We test our method on CIFAR-10 and AudioSet datasets and show that it improves the weak-label classification performance and reduces the computational cost compared to random sampling methods. Our work reveals that negative instances are not all equally irrelevant, and selecting them wisely can benefit weak-label learning.

Title: Importance of negative sampling in weak label learning
Year: 2023
Abstract: Weak-label learning is a challenging task that requires learning from data""bags""containing positive and negative instances, but only the bag labels are known. The pool of negative instances is usually larger than positive instances, thus making selecting the most informative negative instance critical for performance. Such a selection strategy for negative instances from each bag is an open problem that has not been well studied for weak-label learning. In this paper, we study several sampling strategies that can measure the usefulness of negative instances for weak-label learning and select them accordingly. We test our method on CIFAR-10 and AudioSet datasets and show that it improves the weak-label classification performance and reduces the computational cost compared to random sampling methods. Our work reveals that negative instances are not all equally irrelevant, and selecting them wisely can benefit weak-label learning.

Title: Bayes Risk Transducer: Transducer with Controllable Alignment Prediction
Year: 2023
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) based on transducers is widely used. In training, a transducer maximizes the summed posteriors of all paths. The path with the highest posterior is commonly defined as the predicted alignment between the speech and the transcription. While the vanilla transducer does not have a prior preference for any of the valid paths, this work intends to enforce the preferred paths and achieve controllable alignment prediction. Specifically, this work proposes Bayes Risk Transducer (BRT), which uses a Bayes risk function to set lower risk values to the preferred paths so that the predicted alignment is more likely to satisfy specific desired properties. We further demonstrate that these predicted alignments with intentionally designed properties can provide practical advantages over the vanilla transducer. 
Document 1: We further demonstrate that these predicted alignments with intentionally designed properties can provide practical advantages over the vanilla transducer. Experimentally, the proposed BRT saves inference cost by up to 46% for non-streaming ASR and reduces overall system latency by 41% for streaming ASR.

Title: A Via-Less Fully Screen-Printed Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for 5G Millimeter Wave Communication
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a via-less fully screen-printed reconfigurable intelligent surface which can establish a second line-of-sight communication from 23.5GHz to 29.5GHz. By serially connecting the H shaped resonator along the H field of the incident wave, we minimize the effect of the biasing lines and make a via-less design, which reduces the fabrication difficulty and cost. The unit-cell simulation of the array with screen-printed VO2 switches shows a 215° to 160° phase shift difference between the ON and OFF states within bandwidth. During the field testing of the ideal arrays, we verify that the array can redirect the 45° incident wave to 0° reflection with a signal enhancement of at least 10 dB as compared to the array which has all unit cells in the OFF condition.

Title: Improving Perceptual Quality, Intelligibility, and Acoustics on VoIP Platforms
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for fine-tuning models trained on the Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) 2020 Challenge to improve their performance on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications. Our approach involves adapting the DNS 2020 models to the specific acoustic characteristics of VoIP communications, which includes distortion and artifacts caused by compression, transmission, and platform-specific processing. To this end, we propose a multi-task learning framework for VoIP-DNS that jointly optimizes noise suppression and VoIP-specific acoustics for speech enhancement. We evaluate our approach on a diverse VoIP scenarios and show that it outperforms both industry performance and state-of-the-art methods for speech enhancement on VoIP applications.

Title: Integrative Multi-omic Profiling of Two Human Decedents Receiving Pig Heart Xenografts Reveals Strong Perturbations in Early Immune-Cell and Cellular Metabolism Responses
Year: 2023
Abstract: Background Recent advances in xenotransplantation in living and decedent humans using pig xenografts have laid promising groundwork towards future emergency use and first in human trials. Major obstacles remain though, including a lack of knowledge of the genetic incompatibilities between pig donors and human recipients which may led to harmful immune responses against the xenograft or dysregulation of normal physiology. In 2022 two pig heart xenografts were transplanted into two brain-dead human decedents with a minimized immunosuppression regime, primarily to evaluate onset of hyper-acute antibody mediated rejection and sustained xenograft function over 3 days.

Title: Research on torsional stiffness of flexspline-flexible bearing contact pair in harmonic drive based on macro-micro scale modeling
Year: 2023
Abstract: The flexspline and flexible bearing constitute a critical contact pair in a harmonic drive system, and their torsional stiffness has a significant impact on the performance characteristics manifested by the harmonic drive. In this study, a micro scale three-dimensional fractal model was combined with a macro scale finite element simulation method to establish an equivalent torsional stiffness model for the flexspline-flexible bearing contact pair (FS-FB contact pair), which enables the theoretical prediction of the torsional stiffness of this contact pair. A torsional stiffness testing platform was constructed for a harmonic drive, and the consistency between the experimental results of the torsional stiffness curve and the theoretical predictions validates the effectiveness of the proposed model. The influences of torque, installation eccentricity, and deformation coefficient on the torsional stiffness of the FS-FB contact pair were also discussed.

Title: Large Language Models Enable Few-Shot Clustering
Year: 2023
Abstract: Unlike traditional unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised clustering allows users to provide meaningful structure to the data, which helps the clustering algorithm to match the user's intent. Existing approaches to semi-supervised clustering require a significant amount of feedback from an expert to improve the clusters. In this paper, we ask whether a large language model can amplify an expert's guidance to enable query-efficient, few-shot semi-supervised text clustering. We show that LLMs are surprisingly effective at improving clustering. We explore three stages where LLMs can be incorporated into clustering: before clustering (improving input features), during clustering (by providing constraints to the clusterer), and after clustering (using LLMs post-correction). We find incorporating LLMs in the first two stages can routinely provide significant improvements in cluster quality, and that LLMs enable a user to make trade-offs between cost and accuracy to produce desired clusters.

Title: New Methodology for Intertidal Seaweed Biomass Estimation Using Multispectral Data Obtained with Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles
Year: 2023
Abstract: Seaweed assemblages include a variety of structuring species providing habitats, food and shelter for organisms from different trophic levels. Monitoring intertidal seaweed traditionally involves targeting small areas to collect data on species’ biological traits, which is often labour intensive and covers only a small area of the rocky reef under study. Given the various applications for seaweeds and their compounds, there has been an increase in demand for biomass triggered by the development of new markets. Such biomass demand generates new challenges for biomass quantification and the definition of future in-take harvesting commercial quotas by regulating agencies. The use of Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a low-cost yet efficient monitoring solution, combined with new sensors such as multispectral cameras, has been proposed for mapping intertidal reefs and seaweed in particular. 
Document 1: The use of Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a low-cost yet efficient monitoring solution, combined with new sensors such as multispectral cameras, has been proposed for mapping intertidal reefs and seaweed in particular. In this study, a new methodology was developed and validated to quantify intertidal seaweed biomass based on multispectral UAV imagery, which was made available through an easy-to-use QGIS plugin (named SWUAV_BIO) that automates such biomass estimation. This tool was applied to a case study where the standing stock of Fucus spp. beds located at Viana do Castelo rocky shore (northern Portugal) was assessed using UAV multispectral imagery, providing a reference for future UAV-based ecological studies. Although comparison with the in situ assessments showed that biomass was underestimated by 36%, the SWUAV_BIO plugin is a valuable tool, as it provides an expedited (albeit conservative) seaweed standing stock assessment that can be used to monitor seaweed populations, their changes, and assess the effect of harvesting. These data can be used for an informed and sustainable management of seaweed resources by the competent authorities.

Title: MDACE: MIMIC Documents Annotated with Code Evidence
Year: 2023
Abstract: We introduce a dataset for evidence/rationale extraction on an extreme multi-label classification task over long medical documents. One such task is Computer-Assisted Coding (CAC) which has improved significantly in recent years, thanks to advances in machine learning technologies. Yet simply predicting a set of final codes for a patient encounter is insufficient as CAC systems are required to provide supporting textual evidence to justify the billing codes. A model able to produce accurate and reliable supporting evidence for each code would be a tremendous benefit. However, a human annotated code evidence corpus is extremely difficult to create because it requires specialized knowledge. In this paper, we introduce MDACE, the first publicly available code evidence dataset, which is built on a subset of the MIMIC-III clinical records.

Title: Understanding Masked Autoencoders via Hierarchical Latent Variable Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: Masked autoencoder (MAE), a simple and effective self-supervised learning framework based on the reconstruction of masked image regions, has recently achieved prominent success in a variety of vision tasks. Despite the emergence of intriguing empirical observations on MAE, a theoretically principled understanding is still lacking.

Title: Understanding Masked Autoencoders via Hierarchical Latent Variable Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: Masked autoencoder (MAE), a simple and effective self-supervised learning framework based on the reconstruction of masked image regions, has recently achieved prominent success in a variety of vision tasks. Despite the emergence of intriguing empirical observations on MAE, a theoretically principled understanding is still lacking. In this work, we formally characterize and justify existing empirical in-sights and provide theoretical guarantees of MAE. We formulate the underlying data-generating process as a hierarchical latent variable model, and show that under reasonable assumptions, MAE provably identifies a set of latent variables in the hierarchical model, explaining why MAE can extract high-level information from pixels. Further, we show how key hyperparameters in MAE (the masking ratio and the patch size) determine which true latent variables to be recovered, therefore influencing the level of semantic information in the representation. Specifically, extremely large or small masking ratios inevitably lead to low-level representations.

Title: Understanding In-Context Learning via Supportive Pretraining Data
Year: 2023
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) improves language models’ performance on a variety of NLP tasks by simply demonstrating a handful of examples at inference time. It is not well understood why ICL ability emerges, as the model has never been specifically trained on such demonstrations. Unlike prior work that explores implicit mechanisms behind ICL, we study ICL via investigating the pretraining data. Specifically, we first adapt an iterative, gradient-based approach to find a small subset of pretraining data that supports ICL. We observe that a continued pretraining on this small subset significantly improves the model’s ICL ability, by up to 18%. We then compare the supportive subset constrastively with random subsets of pretraining data and discover: (1) The supportive pretraining data to ICL do not have a higher domain relevance to downstream tasks. 
Document 1: We then compare the supportive subset constrastively with random subsets of pretraining data and discover: (1) The supportive pretraining data to ICL do not have a higher domain relevance to downstream tasks. (2) The supportive pretraining data have a higher mass of rarely occurring, long-tail tokens. (3) The supportive pretraining data are challenging examples where the information gain from long-range context is below average, indicating learning to incorporate difficult long-range context encourages ICL. Our work takes a first step towards understanding ICL via analyzing instance-level pretraining data. Our insights have a potential to enhance the ICL ability of language models by actively guiding the construction of pretraining data in the future.

Title: A Magnetically Controlled Guidewire Robot System with Steering and Propulsion Capabilities for Vascular Interventional Surgery
Year: 2023
Abstract: Magnetically manipulated interventional robotic systems offer outstanding advantages for improving vascular interventions, including minimizing radiation exposure to physicians and increasing the controllability of magnetic interventional devices in hard‐to‐reach vessels. However, automatic control of magnetic guidewires (MGs) is still challenging in terms of modeling of guidewires and trajectory planning. Herein, a magnetically controlled guidewire robotic system (MCGRS) with steering and propulsion capabilities is proposed based on adequate modeling and trajectory planning methods. The steering kinematics of MG is first modeled by constant curvature theory. Then, a continuum mechanics model is built to predict the deformation of the magnetic tip by combining the dipole model and the Cosserat‐rod model. Moreover, a trajectory planning algorithm is developed to navigate the MG through vessels. 
Document 1: Finally, two extra navigation experiments are implemented in 3D vascular phantom, which show that the MCGRS can be remotely controlled to manipulate the MG to actively steer and reach the target site. The system and methods will build the foundation for automatic control of MG and help to improve the autonomy.

Title: Application of a Multispectral UAS to Assess the Cover and Biomass of the Invasive Dune Species Carpobrotus edulis
Year: 2023
Abstract: Remote sensing can support dune ecosystem conservation. Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS) equipped with multispectral cameras can provide information for identifying different vegetation species, including Carpobrotus edulis—one of the most prominent alien species in Portuguese dune ecosystems. This work investigates the use of multispectral UAS for C. edulis identification and biomass estimation. A UAS with a five-band multispectral camera was used to capture images from the sand dunes of the Cávado River spit. Simultaneously, field samples of C. edulis were collected for laboratorial quantification of biomass through Dry Weight (DW).

Title: Let's Sample Step by Step: Adaptive-Consistency for Efficient Reasoning and Coding with LLMs
Year: 2023
Abstract: A popular approach for improving the correctness of output from large language models (LLMs) is Self-Consistency - poll the LLM multiple times and output the most frequent solution. Existing Self-Consistency techniques always generate a constant number of samples per question, where a better approach will be to non-uniformly distribute the available budget based on the amount of agreement in the samples generated so far. In response, we introduce Adaptive-Consistency, a cost-efficient, model-agnostic technique that dynamically adjusts the number of samples per question using a lightweight stopping criterion. Our experiments over 17 reasoning and code generation datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that Adaptive-Consistency reduces sample budget by up to 7.9 times with an average accuracy drop of less than 0.1%.

Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a pioneering calorimetric experiment that has been successfully operating in space since December 2015, designed to detect cosmic rays up to unprecedentedly high energies thanks to the fine-grained thick BGO calorimeter and relatively large geometric factor. Among the scientific goals of DAMPE are the precise measurements of cosmic-ray electron plus positron spectrum, including the detection of possible indirect dark matter signatures, spectral measurements of primary and secondary cosmic-ray species, and gamma-ray physics. For electrons and gamma rays, it covers an energy range from GeV to about 10 TeV, with an outstanding energy resolution close to 1%. Proton and ion cosmic rays can be measured up to hundreds of TeV in kinetic energy. In this contribution, we first give an overview of the DAMPE mission and its on-orbit operation status.

Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical
Year: 2023
Abstract: Despite its flexibility to learn diverse inductive biases in machine learning programs, meta learning (i.e., learning to learn) has long been recognized to suffer from poor scalability due to its tremendous compute/memory costs, training instability, and a lack of efficient distributed training support. In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms.

Title: UniverSLU: Universal Spoken Language Understanding for Diverse Classification and Sequence Generation Tasks with a Single Network
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated promising outcomes by employing large language models with multi-tasking capabilities. They utilize prompts to guide the model's behavior and surpass performance of task-specific models. Motivated by this, we ask: can we build a single model that jointly perform various spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks? To address this, we utilize pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and employ various task and dataset specifiers as discrete prompts. We demonstrate efficacy of our single multi-task learning (MTL) model""UniverSLU""for 12 different speech classification and sequence generation tasks across 17 datasets and 9 languages. Results show that UniverSLU achieves competitive performance and even surpasses task-specific models.

Title: CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms
Year: 2023
Abstract: Lexical exact-match systems perform text retrieval efficiently with sparse matching signals and fast retrieval through inverted lists, but naturally suffer from the mismatch between lexical surface form and implicit term semantics. This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF). Each CSF pairs a lexical surface form with a context source, and is represented by a lexical form weight and a contextualized semantic vector representation. This framework is able to perform sparse lexicon-based retrieval by learning to represent each query and document as a ""bag-of-CSFs"", simultaneously addressing two key factors in sparse retrieval: vocabulary expansion of surface form and semantic representation of term meaning. At retrieval time, it efficiently matches CSFs through exact-match of learned surface forms, and effectively scores each CSF pair via contextual semantic representations, leading to joint improvement in both term match and term scoring.

Title: uSee: Unified Speech Enhancement and Editing with Conditional Diffusion Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: Speech enhancement aims to improve the quality of speech signals in terms of quality and intelligibility, and speech editing refers to the process of editing the speech according to specific user needs. In this paper, we propose a Unified Speech Enhancement and Editing (uSee) model with conditional diffusion models to handle various tasks at the same time in a generative manner. Specifically, by providing multiple types of conditions including self-supervised learning embeddings and proper text prompts to the score-based diffusion model, we can enable controllable generation of the unified speech enhancement and editing model to perform corresponding actions on the source speech. Our experiments show that our proposed uSee model can achieve superior performance in both speech denoising and dereverberation compared to other related generative speech enhancement models, and can perform speech editing given desired environmental sound text description, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and room impulse responses (RIR).

Year: 2023
Abstract: Interlinear glossing provides a vital type of morphosyntactic annotation, both for linguists and language revitalists, and numerous conventions exist for representing it formally and computationally. Some of these formats are human readable; others are machine readable. Some are easy to edit with general-purpose tools. Few represent non-concatentative processes like infixation, reduplication, mutation, truncation, and tonal overwriting in a consistent and formally rigorous way (on par with affixation). We propose an annotation conventionâ€”Generalized Glossing Guidelines (GGG) that combines all of these positive properties using an Item-and-Process (IP) framework. We describe the format, demonstrate its linguistic adequacy, and compare it with two other interlinear glossed text annotation schemes.

Year: 2023
Abstract: With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet.

Title: Zero-shot Transfer of Article-aware Legal Outcome Classification for European Court of Human Rights Cases
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this paper, we cast Legal Judgment Prediction on European Court of Human Rights cases into an article-aware classification task, where the case outcome is classified from a combined input of case facts and convention articles. This configuration facilitates the model learning some legal reasoning ability in mapping article text to specific case fact text. It also provides an opportunity to evaluate the model’s ability to generalize to zero-shot settings when asked to classify the case outcome with respect to articles not seen during training. We devise zero-shot experiments and apply domain adaptation methods based on domain discrimination and Wasserstein distance. Our results demonstrate that the article-aware architecture outperforms straightforward fact classification. We also find that domain adaptation methods improve zero-shot transfer performance, with article relatedness and encoder pre-training influencing the effect.

Title: TRPML1 as a potential therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer: a review
Year: 2023
Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most refractory subtype of breast cancer, and effective treatments are urgently needed owing to its poor prognosis. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, alone or in combination, are the leading choices for TNBC therapy. Although promising approaches and procedures have emerged, several challenges, such as off-target effects, drug resistance, and severe side effects, remain to be addressed. Recently, transient receptor potential channel mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) has attracted the attention of researchers because its expression has been implicated in numerous diseases, including cancer. TRPML1 regulates biological events and signaling pathways, including autophagic flux, exocytosis, ionic homeostasis, and lysosomal biogenesis, all contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. 
Document 1: TRPML1 regulates biological events and signaling pathways, including autophagic flux, exocytosis, ionic homeostasis, and lysosomal biogenesis, all contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. TRPML1 also functions as a building block for cancer cell growth, mitogenic signaling, priming tissues for metastasis, and activation of transcriptional programs, processes involved in several malignant tumors. This review provides an overview of breast cancer epidemiology and diagnostic techniques and then discusses the existing therapeutics. Additionally, we elaborate on the development of, and associated challenges to, TNBC diagnostics and treatment and the feasibility of TRPML1 as a therapeutic target for TNBC.

Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical
Year: 2023
Abstract: Despite its flexibility to learn diverse inductive biases in machine learning programs, meta learning (i.e., learning to learn) has long been recognized to suffer from poor scalability due to its tremendous compute/memory costs, training instability, and a lack of efficient distributed training support. In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms.

Title: MRI Features for Predicting Microvascular Invasion and Postoperative Recurrence in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Without Peritumoral Hypointensity
Year: 2023
Abstract: Purpose To identify MRI features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that predict microvascular invasion (MVI) and postoperative intrahepatic recurrence in patients without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointensity. Patients and Methods One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was analyzed. We then assessed the MRI features of HCC that predicted the MVI and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the subgroup without peritumoral HBP hypointensity.

Title: Solving NLP Problems through Human-System Collaboration: A Discussion-based Approach
Year: 2023
Abstract: Humans work together to solve common problems by having discussions, explaining, and agreeing or disagreeing with each other. Similarly, if a system can have discussions with humans when solving tasks, it can improve the system's performance and reliability. In previous research on explainability, it has only been possible for the system to make predictions and for humans to ask questions about them rather than having a mutual exchange of opinions. This research aims to create a dataset and computational framework for systems that discuss and refine their predictions through dialogue. Through experiments, we show that the proposed system can have beneficial discussions with humans improving the accuracy by up to 25 points in the natural language inference task.

Title: SigMoreFun Submission to the SIGMORPHON Shared Task on Interlinear Glossing
Year: 2023
Abstract: In our submission to the SIGMORPHON 2023 Shared Task on interlinear glossing (IGT), we explore approaches to data augmentation and modeling across seven low-resource languages. For data augmentation, we explore two approaches: creating artificial data from the provided training data and utilizing existing IGT resources in other languages. On the modeling side, we test an enhanced version of the provided token classification baseline as well as a pretrained multilingual seq2seq model. Additionally, we apply post-correction using a dictionary for Gitksan, the language with the smallest amount of data. We find that our token classification models are the best performing, with the highest word-level accuracy for Arapaho and highest morpheme-level accuracy for Gitksan out of all submissions. We also show that data augmentation is an effective strategy, though applying artificial data pretraining has very different effects across both models tested.

Title: SmartPlay : A Benchmark for LLMs as Intelligent Agents
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential toward intelligent agents and next-gen automation, but there currently lacks a systematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' abilities as agents. We introduce SmartPlay: both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs as agents. SmartPlay consists of 6 different games, including Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each game test allows us to analyze each capability separately.

Title: Chinese EFL learners different from English natives in cataphora resolution: Evidence from eye-tracking studies
Year: 2023
Abstract: Previous studies on English natives have shown that encountering an English cataphoric pronoun triggers an active search for its antecedent and this searching process is modulated by syntactic constraints. It remains unknown whether the conclusion is universal to EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners, particularly those with distinct L1 like Chinese in linguistic typology. Therefore, this study used two eye-tracking experiments to investigate how Chinese EFL learners resolve English cataphora. The experiments adopted the gender-mismatch paradigm. Experiment 1 investigated whether Chinese EFL learners with different proficiency would adopt the similar processing pattern to English natives and found that gender congruency elicited longer reading times than gender incongruency between the first potential antecedent and the cataphoric pronoun, the effect early observed in high-proficiency relative to low-proficiency learners. 
Document 1: Experiment 2 explored whether the cataphora resolution process was modulated by Binding Principle B and revealed that longer first fixation durations and first pass reading times were observed in gender-mismatch than in gender-match conditions no matter the antecedents are binding-accessible or not while longer regression path durations occurred in gender-mismatch than in gender-match conditions only as the antecedents are binding-accessible. Taken together, these results indicate that Chinese EFL learners also adopt an active search mechanism to resolve cataphoric pronouns, yet along a processing path distinct from English natives’. Specifically, Chinese EFL learners predictively link a cataphoric pronoun to the first potential antecedent in the sentence but only a gender-matching antecedent can prompt them to engage in deep processing of the antecedent. Moreover, the processing time varies with the learners’ English proficiency.

Title: Latest results on searching for fractionally charged particles with the DAMPE experiment
Year: 2023
Abstract: The existence of fractionally charged particles (FCP) is foreseen in extensions of or beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Most of the previously conducted searches for FCPs in cosmic rays were based on experiments underground or at high altitudes. However, there have been few searches for FCPs in cosmic rays carried out in orbit other than AMS-01 flown by a space shuttle and BESS by a balloon at the top of the atmosphere. In this study, we conduct an FCP search in space based on on-orbit data obtained using the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite over a period of five years. Unlike underground experiments, which require an FCP energy of the order of hundreds of GeV, our FCP search starts at only a few GeV. An upper limit of 6 .

Title: Decreased Expression of KLF4 Leading to Functional Deficit in Pediatric Patients with Intestinal Failure and Potential Therapeutic Strategy Using Decanoic Acid
Year: 2023
Abstract: Pediatric intestinal failure (IF) is the reduction in gut function to below the minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients and/or water and electrolytes, such that intravenous supplementation is required to maintain health and/or growth. The overall goal in treating IF is to achieve intestinal adaptation; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. In this study, by performing single-cell RNA sequencing in pediatric IF patients, we found that decreased Kruppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4) may serve as the hub gene responsible for the functional deficit in mature enterocytes in IF patients, leading to the downregulation of solute carrier (SLC) family transporters (e.g., SLC7A9) and, consequently, nutrient malabsorption. 
Document 1: We also found that inducible KLF4 was highly sensitive to the loss of certain enteral nutrients: in a rodent model of total parenteral nutrition mimicking the deprivation of enteral nutrition, the expression of KLF4 dramatically decreased only at the tip of the villus and not at the bottom of crypts. By using IF patient-derived intestinal organoids and Caco-2 cells as in vitro models, we demonstrated that the supplementation of decanoic acid (DA) could significantly induce the expression of KLF4 along with SLC6A4 and SLC7A9, suggesting that DA may function as a potential therapeutic strategy to promote cell maturation and functional improvement. In summary, this study provides new insights into the mechanism of intestinal adaptation depending on KLF4, and proposed potential strategies for nutritional management using DA.
