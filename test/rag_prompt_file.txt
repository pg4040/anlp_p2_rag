Title: GLIMMER: generalized late-interaction memory reranker
Year: 2023
Abstract: Memory-augmentation is a powerful approach for efficiently incorporating external information into language models, but leads to reduced performance relative to retrieving text. Recent work introduced LUMEN, a memory-retrieval hybrid that partially pre-computes memory and updates memory representations on the fly with a smaller live encoder. We propose GLIMMER, which improves on this approach through 1) exploiting free access to the powerful memory representations by applying a shallow reranker on top of memory to drastically improve retrieval quality at low cost, and 2) incorporating multi-task training to learn a general and higher quality memory and live encoder. GLIMMER achieves strong gains in performance at faster speeds compared to LUMEN and FiD on the KILT benchmark of knowledge-intensive tasks.

Title: Cytomegalovirus at the crossroads of immunosenescence and oncogenesis
Year: 2023
Abstract: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), whose genome is around 235 kb, is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that infects between 40% and 95% of the population. Though HCMV infection is commonly asymptomatic and leads to subtle clinical symptoms, it can promote robust immune responses and establish lifelong latency. In addition, in immunocompromised hosts, including individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplant recipients, and developing fetuses it can lead to severe diseases. Immunosenescence, well-defined as the alterations in the immune system, is linked mainly to aging and has been recently gathering considerable attention.

Title: The Influence of Optically Active Impurities on the Performance of Phosphors and Scintillators
Year: 2023
Abstract: This paper provides examples of a strategy employed to improve specific properties of phosphors and scintillators which would otherwise have limited their performance in lighting, cathode-ray tubes, and medical imaging technologies. When electron-hole pairs are produced by the exposure to high-energy radiation, the activator ion in the lattice preferentially captures one of the charge carriers. The subsequent capture of the carrier of opposite charge yields the activator ion luminescence. The carrier of the opposite charge can also be diverted to defects in the lattice. The trapping by defects reduces the brightness of phosphors and is responsible for the unwanted afterglow in scintillators. The strategy that is adopted to suppress the trapping by defects is to deliberately introduce an impurity ion that can compete successfully with the defects for the charge carrier.

Title: Assessment of quality of life after upper extremity transplantation: Framework for patient-reported outcome scale domains
Year: 2023
Abstract: Upper extremity transplantation offers the promise of restored function and regained quality of life (QOL) for individuals who have sustained hand or arm amputation. However, a major challenge for this procedure becoming an accessible treatment option for patients is the lack of standard measures to document benefits to QOL. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures are well-suited for this kind of intervention, where the perspective of the patient is central to defining treatment success. To date, qualitative work with experts, clinicians, and patients has been used to identify the most important domains of QOL for PRO item development. Specifically, our group’s qualitative work has identified several domains of QOL that are unique to individuals who have received upper extremity transplants, which are distinct from topics covered by existing PRO measures.

Title: Generation-driven Contrastive Self-training for Zero-shot Text Classification with Instruction-tuned GPT
Year: 2023
Abstract: Moreover, GPT-based zero-shot classification models tend to make independent predictions over test instances, which can be sub-optimal as the instance correlations and the decision boundaries in the target space are ignored. To address these difficulties and limitations, we propose a new approach to zero-shot text classification, namely \ourmodelshort, which leverages the strong generative power of GPT to assist in training a smaller, more adaptable, and efficient sentence encoder classifier with contrastive self-training. Specifically, GenCo applies GPT in two ways: firstly, it generates multiple augmented texts for each input instance to enhance the semantic embedding of the instance and improve the mapping to relevant labels; secondly, it generates augmented texts conditioned on the predicted label during self-training, which makes the generative process tailored to the decision boundaries in the target space. 
Document 1: In our experiments, GenCo outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets, even when only limited in-domain text data is available.

Title: GRB 200829A: External-shock Origin of the Very Early Prompt Emission?
Year: 2023
Abstract: Long-duration GRB 200829A was detected by Fermi-GBM and Swift-BAT/XRT, and then rapidly observed by other ground-based telescopes. It has a weak γ-ray emission in the very early phase and is followed by a bright spiky γ-ray emission pulse. The radiation spectrum of the very early emission is best fitted by a power-law function with index ∼−1.7. However, the bright spiky γ-ray pulse, especially the time around the peak, exhibits a distinct two-component radiation spectrum, i.e., Band function combined with a blackbody radiation spectrum. We infer the photospheric properties and reveal a medium magnetization at a photospheric position by adopting the initial size of the outflow as r 0 = 109 cm. It implies that the Band component in this pulse may be formed during the dissipation of the magnetic field.

Title: TRPML1 as a potential therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer: a review
Year: 2023
Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most refractory subtype of breast cancer, and effective treatments are urgently needed owing to its poor prognosis. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, alone or in combination, are the leading choices for TNBC therapy. Although promising approaches and procedures have emerged, several challenges, such as off-target effects, drug resistance, and severe side effects, remain to be addressed. Recently, transient receptor potential channel mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) has attracted the attention of researchers because its expression has been implicated in numerous diseases, including cancer. TRPML1 regulates biological events and signaling pathways, including autophagic flux, exocytosis, ionic homeostasis, and lysosomal biogenesis, all contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. 
Document 1: TRPML1 regulates biological events and signaling pathways, including autophagic flux, exocytosis, ionic homeostasis, and lysosomal biogenesis, all contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. TRPML1 also functions as a building block for cancer cell growth, mitogenic signaling, priming tissues for metastasis, and activation of transcriptional programs, processes involved in several malignant tumors. This review provides an overview of breast cancer epidemiology and diagnostic techniques and then discusses the existing therapeutics. Additionally, we elaborate on the development of, and associated challenges to, TNBC diagnostics and treatment and the feasibility of TRPML1 as a therapeutic target for TNBC.

Title: PAMR1 negatively impacts cell proliferation and migration of Human Colon Cancer HT29 Cell Line
Year: 2023
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is becoming one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. Among cancers, it ranks the third place in terms of incidence and the second in terms of mortality. Even though immunological test allows fast and easy diagnostic method, there is no specific and reliable methods for early detection of CRC. Despite different treatments, high risk of re-occurrence is associated with advanced and metastatic CRC stages. An exhaustive knowledge on specific biomarkers or molecular actors involved in CRC could help to eradicate tumors or limit cancer recurrence. In this study, we focused on PAMR1 (Peptidase Domain Containing Associated with Muscle Regeneration 1), which is already considered as a tumor suppressor in breast and cervical cancers.

Title: Contextualized Policy Recovery: Modeling and Interpreting Medical Decisions with Adaptive Imitation Learning
Year: 2023
Abstract: Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision policies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits data-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit medical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of decision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors. Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual information. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task learning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of context-specific policies.

Title: LoFT: Local Proxy Fine-tuning For Improving Transferability Of Adversarial Attacks Against Large Language Model
Year: 2023
Abstract: It has been shown that Large Language Model (LLM) alignments can be circumvented by appending specially crafted attack suffixes with harmful queries to elicit harmful responses. To conduct attacks against private target models whose characterization is unknown, public models can be used as proxies to fashion the attack, with successful attacks being transferred from public proxies to private target models. The success rate of attack depends on how closely the proxy model approximates the private model. We hypothesize that for attacks to be transferrable, it is sufficient if the proxy can approximate the target model in the neighborhood of the harmful query. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \emph{Local Fine-Tuning (LoFT)}, \textit{i.e.}, fine-tuning proxy models on similar queries that lie in the lexico-semantic neighborhood of harmful queries to decrease the divergence between the proxy and target models.

Title: Quantifying & Modeling Feature Interactions: An Information Decomposition Framework
Year: 2023
Abstract: The recent explosion of interest in multimodal applications has resulted in a wide selection of datasets and methods for representing and integrating information from different signals. Despite these empirical advances, there remain fundamental research questions: how can we quantify the nature of interactions that exist among input features? Subsequently, how can we capture these interactions using suitable data-driven methods? To answer this question, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify the degree of redundancy , uniqueness , and synergy across input features, which we term the PID statistics of a multimodal distribution. Using 2 newly proposed estimators that scale to high-dimensional distributions, we demonstrate their usefulness in quantifying the interactions within multimodal datasets, the nature of interactions captured by multimodal models, and principled approaches for model selection. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets where the PID statistics are known and on large-scale multimodal benchmarks where PID estimation was previously impossible.

Title: One-for-All: Generalized LoRA for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning
Year: 2023
Abstract: We present Generalized LoRA (GLoRA), an advanced approach for universal parameter-efficient fine-tuning tasks. Enhancing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), GLoRA employs a generalized prompt module to optimize pre-trained model weights and adjust intermediate activations, providing more flexibility and capability across diverse tasks and datasets. Moreover, GLoRA facilitates efficient parameter adaptation by employing a scalable, modular, layer-wise structure search that learns individual adapter of each layer. Originating from a unified mathematical formulation, GLoRA exhibits strong transfer learning, few-shot learning and domain generalization abilities, as it adapts to new tasks through not only weights but also additional dimensions like activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GLoRA outperforms all previous methods in natural, specialized, and structured vision benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy with fewer parameters and computations.

Title: Joint Prediction and Denoising for Large-Scale Multilingual Self-Supervised Learning
Year: 2023
Abstract: Multilingual self-supervised learning (SSL) has often lagged behind state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods due to the expenses and complexity required to handle many languages. This further harms the reproducibility of SSL, which is already limited to few research groups due to its resource usage. We show that more powerful techniques can actually lead to more efficient pre-training, opening SSL to more research groups. We propose WavLabLM, which extends WavLM’s joint prediction and denoising to 40k hours of data across 136 languages. To build WavLabLM, we devise a novel multi-stage pre-training method, designed to address the language imbalance of multilingual data. WavLabLM achieves comparable performance to XLS-R on ML-SUPERB with less than $10 \%$ of the training data, making SSL realizable with academic compute.

Title: Joint Span Segmentation and Rhetorical Role Labeling with Data Augmentation for Legal Documents
Year: 2023
Abstract: Segmentation and Rhetorical Role Labeling of legal judgements play a crucial role in retrieval and adjacent tasks, including case summarization, semantic search, argument mining etc. Previous approaches have formulated this task either as independent classification or sequence labeling of sentences. In this work, we reformulate the task at span level as identifying spans of multiple consecutive sentences that share the same rhetorical role label to be assigned via classification. We employ semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to jointly learn span segmentation and span label assignment. We further explore three data augmentation strategies to mitigate the data scarcity in the specialized domain of law where individual documents tend to be very long and annotation cost is high. Our experiments demonstrate improvement of span-level prediction metrics with a semi-Markov CRF model over a CRF baseline. This benefit is contingent on the presence of multi sentence spans in the document.

Title: Model-Generated Pretraining Signals Improves Zero-Shot Generalization of Text-to-Text Transformers
Year: 2023
Abstract: This paper explores the effectiveness of model-generated signals in improving zero-shot generalization of text-to-text Transformers such as T5. We study various designs to pretrain T5 using an auxiliary model to construct more challenging token replacements for the main model to denoise. Key aspects under study include the decoding target, the location of the RTD head, and the masking pattern. Based on these studies, we develop a new model, METRO-T0, which is pretrained using the redesigned ELECTRA-Style pretraining strategies and then prompt-finetuned on a mixture of NLP tasks. METRO-T0 outperforms all similar-sized baselines on prompted NLP benchmarks, such as _T0 Eval_ and MMLU, and rivals the state-of-the-art T0-11B model with only **8%** of its parameters.

Title: Murder in a Landscape: The Significance of the Death of Henry Flackett in the Staffordshire Moorlands in 1515
Year: 2023
Abstract: ABSTRACT The history of crime offers us insights into private vengeance, community cohesion, social tensions, the defence of honour and property disputes. Henry Flackett of Stanshope in Alstonefield, Staffordshire, was killed by three assailants known to him in 1515, provoked by a contested heap of manure. A combination of sources provides an unusually vivid and detailed picture of the crime, in which gentry honour played a part, provoking an attempt to enforce the law through the conventional channels of inquest, common law, and equity courts. The event is set in the context of the society, economy and landscape of the Staffordshire Moorlands in a period of agrarian change.

Title: 491. Risk Factors for Severe Pediatric COVID-19: A Systematic Review
Year: 2023
Abstract: Abstract Background Optimal management of COVID-19 in children requires risk stratification based on comorbidities and demographic factors that can predispose to severe disease. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) Pediatric COVID-19 Therapies Task Force, comprised of pediatric infectious diseases physicians, intensivists, and pharmacists from 29 US hospitals, develops clinical guidance for pediatric COVID-19 management. In support of these efforts, a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature was conducted to synthesize the evidence for risk factors for severe pediatric COVID-19. Methods Medline, EMBASE, and CDC databases were searched to identify all relevant publications before July 1, 2022. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify studies that assessed for potential predictors of severe COVID-19 disease in children < 21 years.

Title: PLATFORM BASED ON DATA ANALYTICS AND STATISTICS TO PREDICT AND MONITOR THE INTEGRATED AND INTELLIGENT ENERGY MANAGEMENT OF ENERGY-INTENSIVE BUILDINGS
Year: 2023
Abstract: ABSTRACT: 
Currently, large buildings are often equipped with building management systems (BMS), but either because of the type of control or the difficulty of interacting with them, they do not allow optimization policies to be implemented. As far as energy efficiency is concerned, optimization strategies often result from the analysis of monitored data by a specialist, which slows down both decision making and implementation. 
Aware of this problem, this project arises, in which a complementary platform to the BMS systems is developed to provide them with greater intelligence. 
Document 1: The platform uses the information gathered by the BMS and weather forecasts to predict a building's energy demand and, based on this, optimize energy production at any given moment.
Keywords: Commissioning, Energy efficiency, Smart building, Degree-days, BMS, 6 SIGMA.

Title: Speaker-Independent Acoustic-to-Articulatory Speech Inversion
Year: 2023
Abstract: To build speech processing methods that can handle speech as naturally as humans, researchers have explored multiple ways of building an invertible mapping from speech to an interpretable space. The articulatory space is a promising inversion target, since this space captures the mechanics of speech production. To this end, we build an acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) model that leverages autoregression, adversarial training, and self supervision to generalize to unseen speakers. Our approach obtains 0.784 correlation on an electromagnetic articulography (EMA) dataset, improving the state-of-the-art by 12.5%. Additionally, we show the interpretability of these representations through directly com-paring the behavior of estimated representations with speech production behavior. Finally, we propose a resynthesis-based AAI evaluation metric that does not rely on articulatory labels, demonstrating its efficacy with an 18-speaker dataset.

Title: FacTool: Factuality Detection in Generative AI - A Tool Augmented Framework for Multi-Task and Multi-Domain Scenarios
Year: 2023
Abstract: The emergence of generative pre-trained models has facilitated the synthesis of high-quality text, but it has also posed challenges in identifying factual errors in the generated text. In particular: (1) A wider range of tasks now face an increasing risk of containing factual errors when handled by generative models. (2) Generated texts tend to be lengthy and lack a clearly defined granularity for individual facts. (3) There is a scarcity of explicit evidence available during the process of fact checking. With the above challenges in mind, in this paper, we propose FacTool, a task and domain agnostic framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review) show the efficacy of the proposed method.

Title: Beyond Active Engagement: The Significance of Lurkers in a Polarized Twitter Debate
Year: 2023
Abstract: The emergence of new public forums in the shape of online social media has introduced unprecedented challenges to public discourse, including polarization, misinformation, and the emergence of echo chambers. While existing research has extensively studied the behavior of active users within echo chambers, little attention has been given to the hidden audience, also known as lurkers, who passively consume content without actively engaging. This study aims to estimate the share of the hidden audience and investigate their interplay with the echo chamber effect. Using Twitter as a case study, we analyze a polarized political debate to understand the engagement patterns and factors influencing the hidden audience's presence. Our findings reveal a relevant fraction of users that consume content without active interaction, which underscores the importance of considering their presence in online debates.

Our findings reveal a relevant fraction of users that consume content without active interaction, which underscores the importance of considering their presence in online debates. Notably, our results indicate that the engagement of the hidden audience is primarily influenced by factors such as the reliability of media sources mentioned in tweets rather than the ideological stance of the user that produced the content. These findings highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the hidden audience's role in online debates and how they may influence public opinion.

Title: Synergistic Interface Engineering of RuO2/Co3O4 Heterostructures for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting in Acidic Media
Year: 2023
Abstract: Designing nanocomposites with heterointerface as bifunctional electrocatalysts is a potential strategy to overcome the intrinsic activity limitation of electrocatalytic water splitting in acidic media, but it remains challenging. Herein, the highly efficient RuO2/Co3O4 electrocatalyst with a uniform nanoflower structure is prepared by hydrothermal growth combined with interface engineering. Benefiting from the unique nanostructure, the migration of electrons and intermediates is optimized by the sufficient exposure of abundant micropores and defects. Moreover, the formation of strong electronic interaction at the RuO2/Co3O4 heterointerfaces boosts the electrochemical active surface area and accelerates the reaction kinetics, which effectively improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

Title: Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent text-to-image generation models like DreamBooth have made remarkable progress in generating highly customized images of a target subject, by fine-tuning an ``expert model'' for a given subject from a few examples. However, this process is expensive, since a new expert model must be learned for each subject. In this paper, we present SuTI, a Subject-driven Text-to-Image generator that replaces subject-specific fine tuning with in-context learning. Given a few demonstrations of a new subject, SuTI can instantly generate novel renditions of the subject in different scenes, without any subject-specific optimization. SuTI is powered by apprenticeship learning, where a single apprentice model is learned from data generated by a massive number of subject-specific expert models. Specifically, we mine millions of image clusters from the Internet, each centered around a specific visual subject.

Title: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Trial Assessing If Medium-Chain Triglycerides in Combination with Moderate-Intensity Exercise Increase Muscle Strength in Healthy Middle-Aged and Older Adults
Year: 2023
Abstract: An adequate nutritional intake is recommended for the prevention of physical frailty and sarcopenia. In particular, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are reportedly important for muscle strength in nursing home residents. However, the effects of MCFAs on healthy adults at risk for frailty remain unknown. Hence, a randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) intake and walking on muscle mass and function in healthy, sedentary, middle-aged and older adults with a low body mass index. Three MCT intake groups with different amounts of octanoic and decanoic acid intake were compared with a control group.

Title: Exploratory Analysis of Objective Outcome Measures for the Clinical Assessment of Erosive Tooth Wear
Year: 2023
Abstract: This study proposed using enamel surface texture and thickness for the objective detection and monitoring of erosive tooth wear (ETW), comparing them to the standard subjective Basic Erosive Wear Evaluation (BEWE). Thirty-two subjects (n = 597 teeth) were enrolled in this longitudinal observational clinical study. Enamel thickness (by cross-polarization optical coherence tomography, CP-OCT) and 3D dental microwear parameters, i.e., area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc), anisotropy (Str), and roughness (Sa) (by white-light scanning confocal profilometry), were obtained from buccal surfaces. Buccal, occlusal, and lingual surfaces were scored for BEWE and the maximum score per tooth (BEWEMax) was determined at baseline and 12 months (M12). Data outcome relationships were evaluated (alpha = 0.05).

Title: Towards Multilingual Automatic Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation
Year: 2023
Abstract: The main limiting factor in the development of robust multilingual open-domain dialogue evaluation metrics is the lack of multilingual data and the limited availability of open-sourced multilingual dialogue systems. In this work, we propose a workaround for this lack of data by leveraging a strong multilingual pretrained encoder-based Language Model and augmenting existing English dialogue data using Machine Translation. We empirically show that the naive approach of finetuning a pretrained multilingual encoder model with translated data is insufficient to outperform the strong baseline of finetuning a multilingual model with only source data. Instead, the best approach consists in the careful curation of translated data using MT Quality Estimation metrics, excluding low quality translations that hinder its performance.

Title: Cross-Modal Multi-Tasking for Speech-to-Text Translation via Hard Parameter Sharing
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent works in end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) have proposed multi-tasking methods with soft parameter sharing which leverage machine translation (MT) data via secondary encoders that map text inputs to an eventual cross-modal representation. In this work, we instead propose a ST/MT multi-tasking framework with hard parameter sharing in which all model parameters are shared cross-modally. Our method reduces the speech-text modality gap via a pre-processing stage which converts speech and text inputs into two discrete token sequences of similar length -- this allows models to indiscriminately process both modalities simply using a joint vocabulary. With experiments on MuST-C, we demonstrate that our multi-tasking framework improves attentional encoder-decoder, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), transducer, and joint CTC/attention models by an average of +0.5 BLEU without any external MT data.

Title: LoFT: Local Proxy Fine-tuning For Improving Transferability Of Adversarial Attacks Against Large Language Model
Year: 2023
Abstract: It has been shown that Large Language Model (LLM) alignments can be circumvented by appending specially crafted attack suffixes with harmful queries to elicit harmful responses. To conduct attacks against private target models whose characterization is unknown, public models can be used as proxies to fashion the attack, with successful attacks being transferred from public proxies to private target models. The success rate of attack depends on how closely the proxy model approximates the private model. We hypothesize that for attacks to be transferrable, it is sufficient if the proxy can approximate the target model in the neighborhood of the harmful query. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \emph{Local Fine-Tuning (LoFT)}, \textit{i.e.}, fine-tuning proxy models on similar queries that lie in the lexico-semantic neighborhood of harmful queries to decrease the divergence between the proxy and target models.

Title: Membership Inference Attacks against Language Models via Neighbourhood Comparison
Year: 2023
Abstract: Membership Inference attacks (MIAs) aim to predict whether a data sample was present in the training data of a machine learning model or not, and are widely used for assessing the privacy risks of language models. Most existing attacks rely on the observation that models tend to assign higher probabilities to their training samples than non-training points. However, simple thresholding of the model score in isolation tends to lead to high false-positive rates as it does not account for the intrinsic complexity of a sample. Recent work has demonstrated that reference-based attacks which compare model scores to those obtained from a reference model trained on similar data can substantially improve the performance of MIAs. However, in order to train reference models, attacks of this kind make the strong and arguably unrealistic assumption that an adversary has access to samples closely resembling the original training data. Therefore, we investigate their performance in more realistic scenarios and find that they are highly fragile in relation to the data distribution used to train reference models.

Title: Text Matching Improves Sequential Recommendation by Reducing Popularity Biases
Year: 2023
Abstract: This paper proposes Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommenda-tion model (TASTE), which maps items and users in an embedding space and recommends items by matching their text representations. TASTE verbalizes items and user-item interactions using identifiers and attributes of items. To better characterize user behaviors, TASTE additionally proposes an attention sparsity method, which enables TASTE to model longer user-item interactions by reducing the self-attention computations during encoding. Our experiments show that TASTE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on widely used sequential recommendation datasets. TASTE alleviates the cold start problem by representing long-tail items using full-text modeling and bringing the benefits of pretrained language models to recommendation systems. Our further analyses illustrate that TASTE significantly improves the recommendation accuracy by reducing the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models and returning more appropriate and text-relevant items to satisfy users.

Title: Measurement of Ultra-High-Energy Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission of the Galactic Plane from 10 TeV to 1 PeV with LHAASO-KM2A.
Year: 2023
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic γ-ray emission, mainly produced via interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium and/or radiation field, is a very important probe of the distribution, propagation, and interaction of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. In this Letter, we report the measurements of diffuse γ rays from the Galactic plane between 10 TeV and 1 PeV energies, with the square kilometer array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Diffuse emissions from the inner (15°<l<125°, |b|<5°) and outer (125°<l<235°, |b|<5°) Galactic plane are detected with 29.1σ and 12.7σ significance, respectively.

Title: Ruffle&Riley: Towards the Automated Induction of Conversational Tutoring Systems
Year: 2023
Abstract: Conversational tutoring systems (CTSs) offer learning experiences driven by natural language interaction. They are known to promote high levels of cognitive engagement and benefit learning outcomes, particularly in reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, the time and cost required to author CTS content is a major obstacle to widespread adoption. In this paper, we introduce a novel type of CTS that leverages the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) in two ways: First, the system induces a tutoring script automatically from a lesson text. Second, the system automates the script orchestration via two LLM-based agents (Ruffle&Riley) with the roles of a student and a professor in a learning-by-teaching format. The system allows a free-form conversation that follows the ITS-typical inner and outer loop structure.

Title: End-to-End Evaluation for Low-Latency Simultaneous Speech Translation
Year: 2023
Abstract: The challenge of low-latency speech translation has recently draw significant interest in the research community as shown by several publications and shared tasks. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these different approaches in realistic scenarios. However, currently only specific aspects of the systems are evaluated and often it is not possible to compare different approaches. In this work, we propose the first framework to perform and evaluate the various aspects of low-latency speech translation under realistic conditions. The evaluation is carried out in an end-to-end fashion. This includes the segmentation of the audio as well as the run-time of the different components. Secondly, we compare different approaches to low-latency speech translation using this framework. We evaluate models with the option to revise the output as well as methods with fixed output. Furthermore, we directly compare state-of-the-art cascaded as well as end-to-end systems.

Title: Incremental Blockwise Beam Search for Simultaneous Speech Translation with Controllable Quality-Latency Tradeoff
Year: 2023
Abstract: Blockwise self-attentional encoder models have recently emerged as one promising end-to-end approach to simultaneous speech translation. These models employ a blockwise beam search with hypothesis reliability scoring to determine when to wait for more input speech before translating further. However, this method maintains multiple hypotheses until the entire speech input is consumed -- this scheme cannot directly show a single \textit{incremental} translation to users. Further, this method lacks mechanisms for \textit{controlling} the quality vs. latency tradeoff. We propose a modified incremental blockwise beam search incorporating local agreement or hold-$n$ policies for quality-latency control. We apply our framework to models trained for online or offline translation and demonstrate that both types can be effectively used in online mode.

Title: InPars-Light: Cost-Effective Unsupervised Training of Efficient Rankers
Year: 2023
Abstract: We carried out a reproducibility study of InPars, which is a method for unsupervised training of neural rankers (Bonifacio et al., 2022). As a by-product, we developed InPars-light, which is a simple-yet-effective modification of InPars. Unlike InPars, InPars-light uses 7x-100x smaller ranking models and only a freely available language model BLOOM, which -- as we found out -- produced more accurate rankers compared to a proprietary GPT-3 model. On all five English retrieval collections (used in the original InPars study) we obtained substantial (7%-30%) and statistically significant improvements over BM25 (in nDCG and MRR) using only a 30M parameter six-layer MiniLM-30M ranker and a single three-shot prompt. 
Document 1: Finally, these good results were achieved by re-ranking only 100 candidate documents compared to 1000 used by Bonifacio et al. (2022). We believe that InPars-light is the first truly cost-effective prompt-based unsupervised recipe to train and deploy neural ranking models that outperform BM25. Our code and data is publicly available. https://github.com/searchivarius/inpars_light/

Abstract: Recently there have been efforts to introduce new benchmark tasks for spoken language understanding (SLU), like semantic parsing. In this paper, we describe our proposed spoken semantic parsing system for the quality track (Track 1) in Spoken Language Understanding Grand Challenge which is part of ICASSP Signal Processing Grand Challenge 2023. We experiment with both end-to-end and pipeline systems for this task. Strong automatic speech recognition (ASR) models like Whisper and pretrained Language models (LM) like BART are utilized inside our SLU framework to boost performance. We also investigate the output level combination of various models to get an exact match accuracy of 80.8, which won the 1st place at the challenge.

Title: Impact of outpatient radiotherapy on direct non-medical cost in patients in the Central Macro Region of Peru 2021
Year: 2023
Abstract: Background Financial toxicity arises in cancer patients due to the objective financial burden of the disease or treatment, being associated with worse clinical outcomes. Direct non-medical spending on cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy in Peru under its publicly funded health system has not been described. Objective To know the expenses related to the transfer of the radiotherapy outpatient. Methodology For patients who started radiation therapy in 2021, treatment demographics and expenses related to transporting the patient from home to the radiation therapy center were prospectively collected. Association and connection tests were used, such as the Mann–Whitney/Kruskal–Wallis U-test and Spearman’s Rho. A value of p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Results 398 patients were collected, with average weekly expenses for transportation, lodging and food of $17.04, $6.69 and $45.91, respectively.

Title: AdapITN: A Fast, Reliable, and Dynamic Adaptive Inverse Text Normalization
Year: 2023
Abstract: Inverse text normalization (ITN) is the task that transforms text in spoken-form into written-form. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) produces text in spoken-form, human and natural language understanding systems prefer to consume text in written-form. ITN generally deals with semiotic phrases (e.g., numbers, date, time). However, lack of studies to deal with phonetization phrases, which is ASR’s output when it handles unseen data (e.g., foreign-named entities, domain names), although these exist in the same form in the spoken-form text. The reason is that phonetization phrases are infinite patterns and language-dependent. In this study, we introduce a novel end2end model that can handle both semiotic phrases (SEP) and phonetization phrases (PHP), named AdapITN.

Title: GRB 200829A: External-shock Origin of the Very Early Prompt Emission?
Year: 2023
Abstract: Long-duration GRB 200829A was detected by Fermi-GBM and Swift-BAT/XRT, and then rapidly observed by other ground-based telescopes. It has a weak γ-ray emission in the very early phase and is followed by a bright spiky γ-ray emission pulse. The radiation spectrum of the very early emission is best fitted by a power-law function with index ∼−1.7. However, the bright spiky γ-ray pulse, especially the time around the peak, exhibits a distinct two-component radiation spectrum, i.e., Band function combined with a blackbody radiation spectrum. We infer the photospheric properties and reveal a medium magnetization at a photospheric position by adopting the initial size of the outflow as r 0 = 109 cm. It implies that the Band component in this pulse may be formed during the dissipation of the magnetic field.

Title: Machine Learning for Predicting Forest Fire Occurrence in Changsha: An Innovative Investigation into the Introduction of a Forest Fuel Factor
Year: 2023
Abstract: Affected by global warming and increased extreme weather, Hunan Province saw a phased and concentrated outbreak of forest fires in 2022, causing significant damage and impact. Predicting the occurrence of forest fires can enhance the ability to make early predictions and strengthen early warning and responses. Currently, fire prevention and extinguishing in China’s forests and grasslands face severe challenges due to the overlapping of natural and social factors. Existing forest fire occurrence prediction models mostly take into account vegetation, topographic, meteorological and human activity factors; however, the occurrence of forest fires is closely related to the forest fuel moisture content.

Title: A Wideband Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for 5G Millimeter-Wave Applications
Year: 2023
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands, and the considerable theoretical work reported by the communication community, there is a limited number of published works demonstrating practical implementations and experimental results. To the authors' knowledge, no published literature has reported experimental results for RISs covering the n257 and n258 mm-wave bands. In this work, we propose a novel wideband RIS design that covers the entire mm-wave 5G n257 and n258 bands. In simulations, the unit cell can maintain a phase difference of 180{\deg} +- 20{\deg} and a reflection magnitude greater than -2.8 dB within 22.7 to 30.5 GHz (29.3% bandwidth) using one-bit PIN switches.

Title: A Via-Less Fully Screen-Printed Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for 5G Millimeter Wave Communication
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a via-less fully screen-printed reconfigurable intelligent surface which can establish a second line-of-sight communication from 23.5GHz to 29.5GHz. By serially connecting the H shaped resonator along the H field of the incident wave, we minimize the effect of the biasing lines and make a via-less design, which reduces the fabrication difficulty and cost. The unit-cell simulation of the array with screen-printed VO2 switches shows a 215° to 160° phase shift difference between the ON and OFF states within bandwidth. During the field testing of the ideal arrays, we verify that the array can redirect the 45° incident wave to 0° reflection with a signal enhancement of at least 10 dB as compared to the array which has all unit cells in the OFF condition.

Title: Training on Foveated Images Improves Robustness to Adversarial Attacks
Year: 2023
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- subtle, perceptually indistinguishable perturbations of inputs that change the response of the model. In the context of vision, we hypothesize that an important contributor to the robustness of human visual perception is constant exposure to low-fidelity visual stimuli in our peripheral vision. To investigate this hypothesis, we develop \RBlur, an image transform that simulates the loss in fidelity of peripheral vision by blurring the image and reducing its color saturation based on the distance from a given fixation point. We show that compared to DNNs trained on the original images, DNNs trained on images transformed by \RBlur are substantially more robust to adversarial attacks, as well as other, non-adversarial, corruptions, achieving up to 25\% higher accuracy on perturbed data.

Title: Active Retrieval Augmented Generation
Year: 2023
Abstract: Despite the remarkable ability of large language models (LMs) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens.

Year: 2023
Abstract: Aphasia is a language disorder that affects the speaking ability of millions of patients. This paper presents a new benchmark for Aphasia speech recognition and detection tasks using state-of-the-art speech recognition techniques with the AphsiaBank dataset. Specifically, we introduce two multi-task learning methods based on the CTC/Attention architecture to perform both tasks simultaneously. Our system achieves state-of-the-art speaker-level detection accuracy (97.3%), and a relative WER reduction of 11% for moderate Aphasia patients. In addition, we demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by applying it to another disordered speech database, the DementiaBank Pitt corpus. We will make our all-in-one recipes and pre-trained model publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. Our standardized data preprocessing pipeline and open-source recipes enable researchers to compare results directly, promoting progress in disordered speech processing.

Title: Evaluating Picture Description Speech for Dementia Detection using Image-text Alignment
Year: 2023
Abstract: Using picture description speech for dementia detection has been studied for 30 years. Despite the long history, previous models focus on identifying the differences in speech patterns between healthy subjects and patients with dementia but do not utilize the picture information directly. In this paper, we propose the first dementia detection models that take both the picture and the description texts as inputs and incorporate knowledge from large pre-trained image-text alignment models. We observe the difference between dementia and healthy samples in terms of the text's relevance to the picture and the focused area of the picture. We thus consider such a difference could be used to enhance dementia detection accuracy. Specifically, we use the text's relevance to the picture to rank and filter the sentences of the samples. We also identified focused areas of the picture as topics and categorized the sentences according to the focused areas.

Title: Don't Take This Out of Context! On the Need for Contextual Models and Evaluations for Stylistic Rewriting
Year: 2023
Abstract: Most existing stylistic text rewriting methods and evaluation metrics operate on a sentence level, but ignoring the broader context of the text can lead to preferring generic, ambiguous, and incoherent rewrites. In this paper, we investigate integrating the preceding textual context into both the $\textit{rewriting}$ and $\textit{evaluation}$ stages of stylistic text rewriting, and introduce a new composite contextual evaluation metric $\texttt{CtxSimFit}$ that combines similarity to the original sentence with contextual cohesiveness. We comparatively evaluate non-contextual and contextual rewrites in formality, toxicity, and sentiment transfer tasks. Our experiments show that humans significantly prefer contextual rewrites as more fitting and natural over non-contextual ones, yet existing sentence-level automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, SBERT) correlate poorly with human preferences ($\rho$=0--0.3).

Title: “Easier or Harder, Depending on Who the Hearing Person Is”: Codesigning Videoconferencing Tools for Small Groups with Mixed Hearing Status
Year: 2023
Abstract: With improvements in automated speech recognition and increased use of videoconferencing, real-time captioning has changed significantly. This shift toward broadly available but less accurate captioning invites exploration of the role hearing conversation partners play in shaping the accessibility of a conversation to d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) captioning users. While recent work has explored DHH individuals’ videoconferencing experiences with captioning, we focus on established groups’ current practices and priorities for future tools to support more accessible online conversations. Our study consists of three codesign sessions, conducted with four groups (17 participants total, 10 DHH, 7 hearing). We found that established groups crafted social accessibility norms that met their relational contexts.

However, what is not clear is the degree to which these systems do not work, how they can be improved, or how much people want to use them. In this paper, we first address these questions using results from a 61-person survey from people who stutter and find participants want to use speech recognition but are frequently cut off, misunderstood, or speech predictions do not represent intent. In a second study, where 91 people who stutter recorded voice assistant commands and dictation, we quantify how dysfluencies impede performance in a consumer-grade speech recognition system.

Title: The Relationship between the Serum NLRP1 Level and Coronary Lesions in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease
Year: 2023
Abstract: Background The pathogenesis of coronary artery disease is complex, and inflammation is one of the regulatory factors. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1) plays an important role in the cellular inflammatory response, cell apoptosis, cell death, and autoimmune diseases. Whether the level of NLRP1 is related to the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been reported. Objective To test the serum level of NLRP1 in unstable angina (UA) patients and investigate the effect of NLRP1 on coronary stenosis severity of the coronary artery disease (CAD). 
Document 1: Serum NLRP1 levels were significantly different among different subgroups. The patient's Gensini score was correlated with the patient's serum NLRP1 level. Conclusion The serum NLRP1 level is increased in patients with UA, which is increased with the increasing severity of coronary lesions.

Title: AudioGPT: Understanding and Generating Speech, Music, Sound, and Talking Head
Year: 2023
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. Despite the recent success, current LLMs are not capable of processing complex audio information or conducting spoken conversations (like Siri or Alexa). In this work, we propose a multi-modal AI system named AudioGPT, which complements LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) with 1) foundation models to process complex audio information and solve numerous understanding and generation tasks; and 2) the input/output interface (ASR, TTS) to support spoken dialogue. With an increasing demand to evaluate multi-modal LLMs of human intention understanding and cooperation with foundation models, we outline the principles and processes and test AudioGPT in terms of consistency, capability, and robustness. 
Document 1: With an increasing demand to evaluate multi-modal LLMs of human intention understanding and cooperation with foundation models, we outline the principles and processes and test AudioGPT in terms of consistency, capability, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of AudioGPT in solving AI tasks with speech, music, sound, and talking head understanding and generation in multi-round dialogues, which empower humans to create rich and diverse audio content with unprecedented ease.

Title: TAPLoss: A Temporal Acoustic Parameter Loss for Speech Enhancement
Year: 2023
Abstract: Speech enhancement models have greatly progressed in recent years, but still show limits in perceptual quality of their speech outputs. We propose an objective for perceptual quality based on temporal acoustic parameters. These are fundamental speech features that play an essential role in various applications, including speaker recognition and paralinguistic analysis. We provide a differentiable estimator for four categories of low-level acoustic descriptors involving: frequency-related parameters, energy or amplitude-related parameters, spectral balance parameters, and temporal features. Un-like prior work that looks at aggregated acoustic parameters or a few categories of acoustic parameters, our temporal acoustic parameter (TAP) loss enables auxiliary optimization and improvement of many fine-grained speech characteristics in enhancement workflows. We show that adding TAPLoss as an auxiliary objective in speech enhancement produces speech with improved perceptual quality and intelligibility.

Title: Beyond Single-Mindedness: A Figure-Ground Reversal for the Cognitive Sciences
Year: 2023
Abstract: A fundamental fact about human minds is that they are never truly alone: all minds are steeped in situated interaction. That social interaction matters is recognized by any experimentalist who seeks to exclude its influence by studying individuals in isolation. On this view, interaction complicates cognition. Here, we explore the more radical stance that interaction co-constitutes cognition: that we benefit from looking beyond single minds toward cognition as a process involving interacting minds. All around the cognitive sciences, there are approaches that put interaction center stage. Their diverse and pluralistic origins may obscure the fact that collectively, they harbor insights and methods that can respecify foundational assumptions and fuel novel interdisciplinary work. What might the cognitive sciences gain from stronger interactional foundations? This represents, we believe, one of the key questions for the future.

Title: 3D Open-vocabulary Segmentation with Foundation Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation of 3D scenes is a fundamental function of human perception and thus a crucial objective in computer vision research. However, this task is heavily impeded by the lack of large-scale and diverse 3D open-vocabulary segmentation datasets for training robust and generalizable models. Distilling knowledge from pre-trained 2D open-vocabulary segmentation models helps but it compromises the open-vocabulary feature significantly as the 2D models are mostly finetuned with close-vocabulary datasets. We tackle the challenges in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation by exploiting the open-vocabulary multimodal knowledge and object reasoning capability of pre-trained foundation models CLIP and DINO, without necessitating any fine-tuning. Specifically, we distill open-vocabulary visual and textual knowledge from CLIP into a neural radiance field (NeRF) which effectively lifts 2D features into view-consistent 3D segmentation.

Title: Image–text coherence and its implications for multimodal AI
Year: 2023
Abstract: Human communication often combines imagery and text into integrated presentations, especially online. In this paper, we show how image–text coherence relations can be used to model the pragmatics of image–text presentations in AI systems. In contrast to alternative frameworks that characterize image–text presentations in terms of the priority, relevance, or overlap of information across modalities, coherence theory postulates that each unit of a discourse stands in specific pragmatic relations to other parts of the discourse, with each relation involving its own information goals and inferential connections. Text accompanying an image may, for example, characterize what's visible in the image, explain how the image was obtained, offer the author's appraisal of or reaction to the depicted situation, and so forth. The advantage of coherence theory is that it provides a simple, robust, and effective abstraction of communicative goals for practical applications.

Title: BUFFET: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Few-shot Cross-lingual Transfer
Year: 2023
Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in few-shot generalization in natural language processing, most models are developed and evaluated primarily in English. To facilitate research on few-shot cross-lingual transfer, we introduce a new benchmark, called BUFFET, which unifies 15 diverse tasks across 54 languages in a sequence-to-sequence format and provides a fixed set of few-shot examples and instructions. BUFFET is designed to establish a rigorous and equitable evaluation framework for few-shot cross-lingual transfer across a broad range of tasks and languages. Using BUFFET, we perform thorough evaluations of state-of-the-art multilingual large language models with different transfer methods, namely in-context learning and fine-tuning. Our findings reveal significant room for improvement in few-shot in-context cross-lingual transfer.

Title: Understanding of the Effect of the Adsorption of Atom and Cluster Silver on Chitosan: An In Silico Analysis
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this work, the structural, electronic, and optical stability properties of the chitosan monomer (M-Ch) and atomic silver complex are reported, as well as a unitary cell of a silver cluster in the gas phase and acetic acid. The generalized gradient approximation HSEh1PBE/def2-TZVPP50 results established the structures’ anionic charge (Q = −1|e|) and the doublet state (M = 2). The high cohesive energy indicates structural stability, and the quantum-mechanical descriptors show a high polarity and low chemical reactivity. Also, the quantum-mechanical descriptors present a low work function that shows the structures are suitable for applications in light-emitting diodes. Finally, the electronic behavior observed by the |HOMO-LUMO| gap energy changes depending on the atomic silver incorporated into the complex.

Title: Don't Take This Out of Context! On the Need for Contextual Models and Evaluations for Stylistic Rewriting
Year: 2023
Abstract: Most existing stylistic text rewriting methods and evaluation metrics operate on a sentence level, but ignoring the broader context of the text can lead to preferring generic, ambiguous, and incoherent rewrites. In this paper, we investigate integrating the preceding textual context into both the $\textit{rewriting}$ and $\textit{evaluation}$ stages of stylistic text rewriting, and introduce a new composite contextual evaluation metric $\texttt{CtxSimFit}$ that combines similarity to the original sentence with contextual cohesiveness. We comparatively evaluate non-contextual and contextual rewrites in formality, toxicity, and sentiment transfer tasks. Our experiments show that humans significantly prefer contextual rewrites as more fitting and natural over non-contextual ones, yet existing sentence-level automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, SBERT) correlate poorly with human preferences ($\rho$=0--0.3).

Title: Cost analysis of three-dimensional radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer in Peruvian citizens
Year: 2023
Abstract: Background and objectives The standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer (CC) is chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) followed by high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRBT). The ideal scenario would be under novel intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiation techniques over three-dimensional (3D) radiation therapy. However, radiotherapy (RT) centres in low- and middle-income countries have limited equipment for teletherapy services like HDRBT. This is why the 3D modality is still in use. The objective of this study was to analyse costs in a comparison of 3D versus IMRT versus VMAT based on clinical staging.

Title: 491. Risk Factors for Severe Pediatric COVID-19: A Systematic Review
Year: 2023
Abstract: Abstract Background Optimal management of COVID-19 in children requires risk stratification based on comorbidities and demographic factors that can predispose to severe disease. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) Pediatric COVID-19 Therapies Task Force, comprised of pediatric infectious diseases physicians, intensivists, and pharmacists from 29 US hospitals, develops clinical guidance for pediatric COVID-19 management. In support of these efforts, a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature was conducted to synthesize the evidence for risk factors for severe pediatric COVID-19. Methods Medline, EMBASE, and CDC databases were searched to identify all relevant publications before July 1, 2022. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify studies that assessed for potential predictors of severe COVID-19 disease in children < 21 years.

Year: 2023
Abstract: A community cluster of influenza A(H3N2) caused by viruses with an E199G substitution in PA was detected in Nara, Japan, between February and March 2023. The three patients with these mutant viruses had not received antiviral treatment before specimen collection but patients in the same hospital had. The sequences of the mutant viruses were closely related, suggesting clonal spread in Nara.

Title: Fairness Continual Learning Approach to Semantic Scene Understanding in Open-World Environments
Year: 2023
Abstract: Continual semantic segmentation aims to learn new classes while maintaining the information from the previous classes. Although prior studies have shown impressive progress in recent years, the fairness concern in the continual semantic segmentation needs to be better addressed. Meanwhile, fairness is one of the most vital factors in deploying the deep learning model, especially in human-related or safety applications. In this paper, we present a novel Fairness Continual Learning approach to the semantic segmentation problem. In particular, under the fairness objective, a new fairness continual learning framework is proposed based on class distributions. Then, a novel Prototypical Contrastive Clustering loss is proposed to address the significant challenges in continual learning, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and background shift. Our proposed loss has also been proven as a novel, generalized learning paradigm of knowledge distillation commonly used in continual learning.

Our proposed loss has also been proven as a novel, generalized learning paradigm of knowledge distillation commonly used in continual learning. Moreover, the proposed Conditional Structural Consistency loss further regularized the structural constraint of the predicted segmentation. Our proposed approach has achieved State-of-the-Art performance on three standard scene understanding benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal VOC, and promoted the fairness of the segmentation model.

Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical
Year: 2023
Abstract: Despite its flexibility to learn diverse inductive biases in machine learning programs, meta learning (i.e., learning to learn) has long been recognized to suffer from poor scalability due to its tremendous compute/memory costs, training instability, and a lack of efficient distributed training support. In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms.

Title: Unlimiformer: Long-Range Transformers with Unlimited Length Input
Year: 2023
Abstract: Since the proposal of transformers, these models have been limited to bounded input lengths, because of their need to attend to every token in the input. In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time; this way, we can index practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization benchmarks, showing that it can process even 500k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time.

Title: Exploring Artificial Intelligence in English Language Arts with StoryQ
Year: 2023
Abstract: Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) in English Language Arts (ELA) with StoryQ is a 10-hour curriculum module designed for high school ELA classes. The module introduces students to fundamental AI concepts and essential machine learning workflow using StoryQ, a web-based GUI environment for Grades 6-12 learners. In this module, students work with unstructured text data and learn to train, test, and improve text classification models such as intent recognition, clickbait filter, and sentiment analysis. As they interact with machine-learning language models deeply, students also gain a nuanced understanding of language and how to wield it, not just as a data structure, but as a tool in our human-human encounters as well. The current version contains eight lessons, all delivered through a full-featured online learning and teaching platform. Computers and Internet access are required to implement the module.

Title: Expression of ALCAM in Clinical Colon Cancer and Relationship With Patients’ Treatment Responses
Year: 2023
Abstract: Background/Aim: Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) plays an important role in cancer via its homotypical and heterotypical interactions with ALCAM or other proteins and can also mediate cell-cell interactions. The present study investigated the expression of ALCAM in relation to epithelial–to–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and its downstream signal proteins including Ezrin-Moesin-Radixin (ERM), in clinical colon cancer and in the progression of the disease. Materials and Methods: Expression of ALCAM was determined in a clinical colon cancer cohort and assessed against the clinical pathological factors and outcome, together with the expression patterns of the ERM family and EMT markers. ALCAM protein was detected using immunohistochemistry. Cell line models, with ALCAM knock-down and over-expression, were established and used to test cells’ responses to drugs. 
Document 1: Conclusion: Reduced expression of ALCAM in colon cancer is an indicator of disease progression and a poor prognostic indicator for patient’s survival. However, ALCAM can enhance the adhesion ability of cancer cells and render them resistant to chemotherapy drugs.

Title: Teaching open and reproducible scholarship: a critical review of the evidence base for current pedagogical methods and their outcomes
Year: 2023
Abstract: In recent years, the scientific community has called for improvements in the credibility, robustness and reproducibility of research, characterized by increased interest and promotion of open and transparent research practices. While progress has been positive, there is a lack of consideration about how this approach can be embedded into undergraduate and postgraduate research training. Specifically, a critical overview of the literature which investigates how integrating open and reproducible science may influence student outcomes is needed. In this paper, we provide the first critical review of literature surrounding the integration of open and reproducible scholarship into teaching and learning and its associated outcomes in students. Our review highlighted how embedding open and reproducible scholarship appears to be associated with (i) students' scientific literacies (i.e. students’ understanding of open research, consumption of science and the development of transferable skills); (ii) student engagement (i.e.

Title: Inference of single cell profiles from histology stains with the Single-Cell omics from Histology Analysis Framework (SCHAF)
Year: 2023
Abstract: Tissue biology involves an intricate balance between cell-intrinsic processes and interactions between cells organized in specific spatial patterns, which can be respectively captured by single-cell profiling methods, such as single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and histology imaging data, such as Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) stains. While single-cell profiles provide rich molecular information, they can be challenging to collect routinely and do not have spatial resolution. Conversely, histological H&E assays have been a cornerstone of tissue pathology for decades, but do not directly report on molecular details, although the observed structure they capture arises from molecules and cells. 
Document 1: Conversely, histological H&E assays have been a cornerstone of tissue pathology for decades, but do not directly report on molecular details, although the observed structure they capture arises from molecules and cells. Here, we leverage adversarial machine learning to develop SCHAF (Single-Cell omics from Histology Analysis Framework), to generate a tissue sample’s spatially-resolved single-cell omics dataset from its H&E histology image. We demonstrate SCHAF on two types of human tumors—from lung and metastatic breast cancer—training with matched samples analyzed by both sc/snRNA-seq and by H&E staining. SCHAF generated appropriate single-cell profiles from histology images in test data, related them spatially, and compared well to ground-truth scRNA-Seq, expert pathologist annotations, or direct MERFISH measurements. SCHAF opens the way to next-generation H&E2.0 analyses and an integrated understanding of cell and tissue biology in health and disease.

Title: Generation-driven Contrastive Self-training for Zero-shot Text Classification with Instruction-tuned GPT
Year: 2023
Abstract: Moreover, GPT-based zero-shot classification models tend to make independent predictions over test instances, which can be sub-optimal as the instance correlations and the decision boundaries in the target space are ignored. To address these difficulties and limitations, we propose a new approach to zero-shot text classification, namely \ourmodelshort, which leverages the strong generative power of GPT to assist in training a smaller, more adaptable, and efficient sentence encoder classifier with contrastive self-training. Specifically, GenCo applies GPT in two ways: firstly, it generates multiple augmented texts for each input instance to enhance the semantic embedding of the instance and improve the mapping to relevant labels; secondly, it generates augmented texts conditioned on the predicted label during self-training, which makes the generative process tailored to the decision boundaries in the target space.

Title: PESCO: Prompt-enhanced Self Contrastive Learning for Zero-shot Text Classification
Year: 2023
Abstract: We present PESCO, a novel contrastive learning framework that substantially improves the performance of zero-shot text classification. We formulate text classification as a neural text retrieval problem where each document is treated as a query, and the system learns the mapping from each query to the relevant class labels by (1) adding prompts to enhance label retrieval, and (2) using retrieved labels to enrich the training set in a self-training loop of contrastive learning. PESCO achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text classification datasets. On DBpedia, we achieve 98.5% accuracy without any labeled data, which is close to the fully-supervised result. Extensive experiments and analyses show all the components of PESCO are necessary for improving the performance of zero-shot text classification.

Title: Language Models Get a Gender Makeover: Mitigating Gender Bias with Few-Shot Data Interventions
Year: 2023
Abstract: Societal biases present in pre-trained large language models are a critical issue as these models have been shown to propagate biases in countless downstream applications, rendering them unfair towards specific groups of people. Since large-scale retraining of these models from scratch is both time and compute-expensive, a variety of approaches have been previously proposed that de-bias a pre-trained model. While the majority of current state-of-the-art debiasing methods focus on changes to the training regime, in this paper, we propose data intervention strategies as a powerful yet simple technique to reduce gender bias in pre-trained models. Specifically, we empirically show that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 debiased (intervened) training examples, the tendency to favor any gender is significantly reduced.

Title: The Hidden Dance of Phonemes and Visage: Unveiling the Enigmatic Link between Phonemes and Facial Features
Year: 2023
Abstract: This work unveils the enigmatic link between phonemes and facial features. Traditional studies on voice-face correlations typically involve using a long period of voice input, including generating face images from voices and reconstructing 3D face meshes from voices. However, in situations like voice-based crimes, the available voice evidence may be short and limited. Additionally, from a physiological perspective, each segment of speech -- phoneme -- corresponds to different types of airflow and movements in the face. Therefore, it is advantageous to discover the hidden link between phonemes and face attributes. In this paper, we propose an analysis pipeline to help us explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.e., phonemes v.s. facial anthropometric measurements (AM). We build an estimator for each phoneme-AM pair and evaluate the correlation through hypothesis testing.

Title: Accuracy of narrow band imaging for detecting the malignant transformation of oral potentially malignant disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis
Year: 2023
Abstract: Objective Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) are a spectrum of diseases that harbor the potential of malignant transformation and developing into oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Narrow band imaging (NBI) has been clinically utilized for the adjuvant diagnosis of OPMD and OSCC. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of NBI for malignant transformations of OPMD by applying the intraepithelial papillary capillary loop (IPCL) classification approach. Methods Studies reporting the diagnostic validity of NBI in the detection of OPMD/OSCC were selected. Four databases were searched and 11 articles were included in the meta-analysis. We performed four subgroup analyses by defining IPCL I/II as negative diagnostic results and no/mild dysplasia as negative pathological outcome. Pooled data were analyzed using random-effects models.

Title: Convoifilter: A case study of doing cocktail party speech recognition
Year: 2023
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker's voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR's word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning. We openly share our pre-trained model to foster further research hf.co/nguyenvulebinh/voice-filter.

Title: PLATFORM BASED ON DATA ANALYTICS AND STATISTICS TO PREDICT AND MONITOR THE INTEGRATED AND INTELLIGENT ENERGY MANAGEMENT OF ENERGY-INTENSIVE BUILDINGS
Year: 2023
Abstract: ABSTRACT: 
Currently, large buildings are often equipped with building management systems (BMS), but either because of the type of control or the difficulty of interacting with them, they do not allow optimization policies to be implemented. As far as energy efficiency is concerned, optimization strategies often result from the analysis of monitored data by a specialist, which slows down both decision making and implementation. 
Aware of this problem, this project arises, in which a complementary platform to the BMS systems is developed to provide them with greater intelligence. 
Document 1: As far as energy efficiency is concerned, optimization strategies often result from the analysis of monitored data by a specialist, which slows down both decision making and implementation. 
Aware of this problem, this project arises, in which a complementary platform to the BMS systems is developed to provide them with greater intelligence. For its design, the Puerta del Hierro Hospital in Madrid has been taken as a pilot case, from the data captured by its own BMS and using the 6 SIGMA methodology, algorithms have been developed capable of optimizing the production systems themselves, thus helping to make up for the weaknesses in the operation of the systems and reducing energy consumption, minimizing the environmental impact and allowing to obtain the maximum performance of its assets. 
The platform uses the information gathered by the BMS and weather forecasts to predict a building's energy demand and, based on this, optimize energy production at any given moment.
Keywords: Commissioning, Energy efficiency, Smart building, Degree-days, BMS, 6 SIGMA.

Title: Poverty Alleviation Resettlement and Household Natural Resources Dependence: A Case Study from Ankang Prefecture, China
Year: 2023
Abstract: In order to assess the degree to which China’s poverty alleviation resettlement (PAR) has been able to address the development conundrum of natural resources reliance and human welfare, it was necessary to investigate the effects of PAR on rural households with regard to their dependence on natural resources. This article evaluated households’ natural resources dependence in rural China by constructing a natural resources dependence index and empirically analyzing the effect of PAR on households by using household survey data from Ankang Prefecture, located in southern Shaanxi Province. The findings demonstrated that PAR could effectively decrease the dependence of households on local natural resources, thus safeguarding the natural environment. Moreover, there were noteworthy distinctions regarding households’ natural resources dependence.

Title: Beyond Single-Mindedness: A Figure-Ground Reversal for the Cognitive Sciences
Year: 2023
Abstract: A fundamental fact about human minds is that they are never truly alone: all minds are steeped in situated interaction. That social interaction matters is recognized by any experimentalist who seeks to exclude its influence by studying individuals in isolation. On this view, interaction complicates cognition. Here, we explore the more radical stance that interaction co-constitutes cognition: that we benefit from looking beyond single minds toward cognition as a process involving interacting minds. All around the cognitive sciences, there are approaches that put interaction center stage. Their diverse and pluralistic origins may obscure the fact that collectively, they harbor insights and methods that can respecify foundational assumptions and fuel novel interdisciplinary work. What might the cognitive sciences gain from stronger interactional foundations? This represents, we believe, one of the key questions for the future.

Title: Widely Targeted Metabolomics Was Used to Reveal the Differences between Non-Volatile Compounds in Different Wines and Their Associations with Sensory Properties
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this study, metabolites from six varieties of wines, including ‘Haasan’ (A1), ‘Zuoshaner’ (A2), ‘Beibinghong’ (A3), ‘Shuanghong’ (A4), ‘Zijingganlu’ (A5), and ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ (A6), were identified and quantified using widely targeted metabolomics analysis techniques. Based on the test results, 1172 metabolites were detected and classified into 18 categories. These include 62 amino acids, 178 alkaloids, 189 flavonoids, 106 phenols, 148 terpenoids, etc. Comparing the differential metabolites between the comparison groups of each variety, differences between varieties based on P-values and VIP values were shown. 
Document 1: These include 62 amino acids, 178 alkaloids, 189 flavonoids, 106 phenols, 148 terpenoids, etc. Comparing the differential metabolites between the comparison groups of each variety, differences between varieties based on P-values and VIP values were shown. Among these differential metabolites, Trimethoprim and Crotonoside were screened out as core differential metabolites. Multiple comparisons also screened the biomarkers for each species. We used widely targeted metabolomics to reveal the differences between non-volatile compounds in different wines and their associations with sensory properties. We also used the simultaneous weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to correlate metabolites with sensory traits, including color difference values and taste characteristics. Two of the six key modules were screened by WGCNA for relevance to sensory traits (brown module and turquoise module). This study provides a high-throughput method for linking compounds to various sensory characteristics of food, opening up new avenues for explaining differences in different varieties of wine.

Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2023 Challenge: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction
Year: 2023
Abstract: Previous Multimodal Information based Speech Processing (MISP) challenges mainly focused on audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) with commendable success. However, the most advanced back-end recognition systems often hit performance limits due to the complex acoustic environments. This has prompted a shift in focus towards the Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction (AVTSE) task for the MISP 2023 challenge in ICASSP 2024 Signal Processing Grand Challenges. Unlike existing audio-visual speech enhance-ment challenges primarily focused on simulation data, the MISP 2023 challenge uniquely explores how front-end speech processing, combined with visual clues, impacts back-end tasks in real-world scenarios. This pioneering effort aims to set the first benchmark for the AVTSE task, offering fresh insights into enhancing the ac-curacy of back-end speech recognition systems through AVTSE in challenging and real acoustic environments.

Title: ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages
Year: 2023
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) implicitly learn to perform a range of language tasks, including machine translation (MT). Previous studies explore aspects of LLMs’ MT capabilities. However, there exist a wide variety of languages for which recent LLM MT performance has never before been evaluated. Without published experimental evidence on the matter, it is difficult for speakers of the world’s diverse languages to know how and whether they can use LLMs for their languages. We present the first experimental evidence for an expansive set of 204 languages, along with MT cost analysis, using the FLORES-200 benchmark. Trends reveal that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages (HRLs) but consistently lag for low-resource languages (LRLs), under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages we covered.

Title: Speech collage: code-switched audio generation by collaging monolingual corpora
Year: 2023
Abstract: Designing effective automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Code-Switching (CS) often depends on the availability of the transcribed CS resources. To address data scarcity, this paper introduces Speech Collage, a method that synthesizes CS data from monolingual corpora by splicing audio segments. We further improve the smoothness quality of audio generation using an overlap-add approach. We investigate the impact of generated data on speech recognition in two scenarios: using in-domain CS text and a zero-shot approach with synthesized CS text. Empirical results highlight up to 34.4% and 16.2% relative reductions in Mixed-Error Rate and Word-Error Rate for in-domain and zero-shot scenarios, respectively. Lastly, we demonstrate that CS augmentation bolsters the model's code-switching inclination and reduces its monolingual bias.

Title: Making Scalable Meta Learning Practical
Year: 2023
Abstract: Despite its flexibility to learn diverse inductive biases in machine learning programs, meta learning (i.e., learning to learn) has long been recognized to suffer from poor scalability due to its tremendous compute/memory costs, training instability, and a lack of efficient distributed training support. In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms.

Abstract: Protoform reconstruction is the task of inferring what morphemes or words appeared like in the ancestral languages of a set of daughter languages. Meloni et al (2021) achieved the state-of-the-art on Latin protoform reconstruction with an RNN-based encoder-decoder with attention model. We update their model with the state-of-the-art seq2seq model: the Transformer. Our model outperforms their model on a suite of different metrics on two different datasets: their Romance data of 8,000 cognates spanning 5 languages and a Chinese dataset (Hou 2004) of 800+ cognates spanning 39 varieties. We also probe our model for potential phylogenetic signal contained in the model. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cmu-llab/acl-2023.
