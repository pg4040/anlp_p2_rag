Senior Systems Scientist/Chair of Admissions, Language Technologies Institute
Research Area : Information Extraction, Summarization and Question Answering, Information Retrieval, Text Mining and Analytics, Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics

Research:
My research interests primarily revolve around multilingual processing, with sidelines in text categorization and information extraction:
Machine Translation
I have worked primarily on example-based machine translation (EBMT), a data-driven translation approach that originated a few years before statistical machine translation characterized by the use of individual examples from the training corpus during translation. I have also applied my EBMT system to cross-language information retrieval and speech-to-speech translation.

Digital Forensics
I have worked on reconstructing corrupted ZIP archives and on extracting text in arbitrary encodings from files and raw disk images. As part of this work, I developed language identification for more than 1,300 languages, and am continuing to improve the accuracy with which languages can be identified.

Information Extraction
My current work focuses on extracting actions and affected components from aircraft maintenance records.

Title: Fairness Through Domain Awareness: Mitigating Popularity Bias For Music Discovery
Year: 2023
Abstract: As online music platforms grow, music recommender systems play a vital role in helping users navigate and discover content within their vast musical databases. At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias, which causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially more relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic relationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this issue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which addresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender systems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth listening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should be reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful music discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music domain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing recommendations at both the playlist level and user level.

Title: Clusterin protects mature dendritic cells from reactive oxygen species mediated cell death
Year: 2023
Abstract: ABSTRACT Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the induction of the adaptive immune response. They capture antigens in peripheral tissues and prime naïve T lymphocytes, triggering the adaptive immune response. In the course of inflammatory processes DCs face stressful conditions including hypoxia, low pH and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), among others. How DCs survive under these adverse conditions remain poorly understood. Clusterin is a protein highly expressed by tumors and usually associated with bad prognosis. It promotes cancer cell survival by different mechanisms such as apoptosis inhibition and promotion of autophagy. Here, we show that, upon maturation, human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) up-regulate clusterin expression. Clusterin protects MoDCs from ROS-mediated toxicity, enhancing DC survival and promoting their ability to induce T cell activation.

AI, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics
Research
I am interested in artificial intelligence and its application to real-world problems. Over the years, I have worked in many areas of AI, including knowledge representation, planning, image processing, machine learning, massively parallel approaches to search and inference, and the development of improved learning algorithms for artificial neural networks.
My current project is Scone, an open-source knowledge representation system and inference engine that can be used as a component in a variety of knowledge-based systems. Scone puts particular emphasis on efficiency, scalability (up to millions of entities and statements) and ease of use. One goal of our research is to support natural-language understanding, all the way from text or speech to a language-independent representation that we can reason about. This requires extensive use of background knowledge not included in the text itself. We are also working to extend Scone's capabilities for ""episodic"" representation and reasoning, by which we mean actions, events, sequences of actions, plans, goals and explanations.

Title: A study of Forbush Decreases effects with DAMPE experiment
Year: 2023
Abstract: Forbush Decrease (FD) is a rapid decrease and slow recover in the observed galactic cosmic ray intensity, caused by active solar events sweeping low energy galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) away from Earth. Differnet properties of FDs have been observed by different scientific experiment but mostly from worldwide ground based Neutron Monitors (NMS), they focus on secondary neutron from the atmosphere. The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a satellite-based cosmic-ray experiment that has been stably operated for more than 7 years. Precise measurements of cosmic ray electrons and positrons from DAMPE make it possible to directly study FDs from a new perspective. We analyze the FD properties, such as decrease amplitude and recover time as a function of energy, observed by DAMPE from 2017 to 2021. Finally we simulate the FDs with a numerical model, and successfully reproduce the FDs.

Title: Improving Audio Captioning Models with Fine-grained Audio Features, Text Embedding Supervision, and LLM Mix-up Augmentation
Year: 2023
Abstract: Automated audio captioning (AAC) aims to generate informative descriptions for various sounds from nature and/or human activities. In recent years, AAC has quickly attracted research interest, with state-of-the-art systems now relying on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) backbone powered by strong models such as Transformers. Following the macro-trend of applied machine learning research, in this work, we strive to improve the performance of seq2seq AAC models by extensively leveraging pretrained models and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we utilize BEATs to extract fine-grained audio features. Then, we employ Instructor LLM to fetch text embeddings of captions, and infuse their language-modality knowledge into BEATs audio features via an auxiliary InfoNCE loss function.

My research centers on interactive systems that use speech. I am currently interested in the following problems:

Implicit Learning : Human-computer interaction generates information that the system could use to modify its behavior. For example, a speech recognition error that is repaired leaves information about a misclassification that could be used to improve subsequent accuracy. Exploiting such situations (and in fact contriving to create them) can provide a rich set of experiences that drive self-improving systems

Automatic detection and recovery from error: Humans easily detect and recover from breakdowns in communication. Automatic systems are less successful at this, however we can use features of recognition, understanding and dialog to predict the likelihood of misunderstanding at a given point in an interaction, and then apply heuristic strategies for guiding the conversation back onto track.

Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics

for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4
Year: 2023
Abstract: The advent and fast development of neural networks have revolutionized the research on dialogue systems and subsequently have triggered various challenges regarding their automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation of open-domain dialogue systems as an open challenge has been the center of the attention of many researchers. Despite the consistent efforts to improve automatic metrics’ correlations with human evaluation, there have been very few attempts to assess their robustness over multiple domains and dimensions. Also, their focus is mainly on the English language. All of these challenges prompt the development of automatic evaluation metrics that are reliable in various domains, dimensions, and languages. This track in the 11th Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC11) is part of the ongoing effort to promote robust and multilingual automatic evaluation metrics. This article describes the datasets and baselines provided to participants and discusses the submission and result details of the two proposed subtasks.

Title: Structured Dialogue Discourse Parsing
Year: 2023
Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to uncover the internal structure of a multi-participant conversation by finding all the discourse links and corresponding relations. Previous work either treats this task as a series of independent multiple-choice problems, in which the link existence and relations are decoded separately, or the encoding is restricted to only local interaction, ignoring the holistic structural information. In contrast, we propose a principled method that improves upon previous work from two perspectives: encoding and decoding. From the encoding side, we perform structured encoding on the adjacency matrix followed by the matrix-tree learning algorithm, where all discourse links and relations in the dialogue are jointly optimized based on latent tree-level distribution. From the decoding side, we perform structured inference using the modified Chiu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm, which explicitly generates the labeled multi-root non-projective spanning tree that best captures the discourse structure. In addition, unlike in previous work, we do not rely on hand-crafted features; this improves the model’s robustness.

My research is concerned with language and its role in human communication. In particular, my long-term research goal is to break down barriers in human-human or human-machine communication through the development of natural language processing (NLP) technologies. This includes the development of technology for machine translation, which helps break down barriers in communication for people who speak different languages, and natural language understanding, which helps computers understand and respond to human language. Within this overall goal of breaking down barriers to human communication, I have focused on several aspects of language that both make it interesting as a scientific subject, and hold potential for the construction of practical systems.

Advances in core NLP technology: Human language is complex and nuanced, and handling this complexity in a computational way requires sophisticated algorithms or learning techniques, the development of which is far from a solved problem. The first major area of my work focuses on advances in core NLP technology, which improve the accuracy with which we can analyze, translate, generate, or reply to textual inputs.

Title: A Gold Standard Dataset for the Reviewer Assignment Problem
Year: 2023
Abstract: Many peer-review venues are either using or looking to use algorithms to assign submissions to reviewers. The crux of such automated approaches is the notion of the""similarity score""--a numerical estimate of the expertise of a reviewer in reviewing a paper--and many algorithms have been proposed to compute these scores. However, these algorithms have not been subjected to a principled comparison, making it difficult for stakeholders to choose the algorithm in an evidence-based manner. The key challenge in comparing existing algorithms and developing better algorithms is the lack of the publicly available gold-standard data that would be needed to perform reproducible research. We address this challenge by collecting a novel dataset of similarity scores that we release to the research community. Our dataset consists of 477 self-reported expertise scores provided by 58 researchers who evaluated their expertise in reviewing papers they have read previously. We use this data to compare several popular algorithms employed in computer science conferences and come up with recommendations for stakeholders.

Title: Solving NLP Problems through Human-System Collaboration: A Discussion-based Approach
Year: 2023
Abstract: Humans work together to solve common problems by having discussions, explaining, and agreeing or disagreeing with each other. Similarly, if a system can have discussions with humans when solving tasks, it can improve the system's performance and reliability. In previous research on explainability, it has only been possible for the system to make predictions and for humans to ask questions about them rather than having a mutual exchange of opinions. This research aims to create a dataset and computational framework for systems that discuss and refine their predictions through dialogue. Through experiments, we show that the proposed system can have beneficial discussions with humans improving the accuracy by up to 25 points in the natural language inference task.

Research
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, computational linguistics and signal processing — building the computational foundations to enable computers with the abilities to analyze, recognize and predict subtle human communicative behaviors during social interactions. Human face-to-face communication is a little like a dance: participants continuously adjust their behaviors based on their interlocutor’s speech, gestures and facial expressions during social interaction. The actual sophistication of human communication comes to the fore when we try to create computers that can understand and participate, however crudely, in this type of social interaction.

Title: Expanding the Role of Affective Phenomena in Multimodal Interaction Research
Year: 2023
Abstract: In recent decades, the field of affective computing has made substantial progress in advancing the ability of AI systems to recognize and express affective phenomena, such as affect and emotions, during human-human and human-machine interactions. This paper describes our examination of research at the intersection of multimodal interaction and affective computing, with the objective of observing trends and identifying understudied areas. We examined over 16,000 papers from selected conferences in multimodal interaction, affective computing, and natural language processing: ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, AAAC International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction, Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. We identified 910 affect-related papers and present our analysis of the role of affective phenomena in these papers.

Question: What models did Morency create?
Context: These energy-based probabilistic models must address core computational issues with human communication dynamics, including hierarchical and nonlinear feature representation, multiview learning and potential over fitting on smaller training sets. For example, I created a family of latent probabilistic models (HCRF, LDCRF, CCNF, etc.) designed to automatically learn the hidden dynamics present in human verbal and nonverbal communication.

Health Behavior Informatics
This research has many applications in education (learning analytics), business (negotiation, interpersonal skills training) and social multimedia (opinion mining, social influence). One area I am particularly excited about is the development of new decision support tools for healthcare applications. For example, how can we quantify, analyze and summarize patient verbal and nonverbal behaviors during psychotherapy? This information could not only help clinicians between therapy sessions but also facilitate collaboration with other medical team members by providing objective behavior measures for the patient’s medical record.

Title: Language Models Get a Gender Makeover: Mitigating Gender Bias with Few-Shot Data Interventions
Year: 2023
Abstract: Societal biases present in pre-trained large language models are a critical issue as these models have been shown to propagate biases in countless downstream applications, rendering them unfair towards specific groups of people. Since large-scale retraining of these models from scratch is both time and compute-expensive, a variety of approaches have been previously proposed that de-bias a pre-trained model. While the majority of current state-of-the-art debiasing methods focus on changes to the training regime, in this paper, we propose data intervention strategies as a powerful yet simple technique to reduce gender bias in pre-trained models. Specifically, we empirically show that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 debiased (intervened) training examples, the tendency to favor any gender is significantly reduced.

Multimodal Computing and Interaction, Speech Processing, Spoken Interfaces and Dialogue Processing

Research
My research centers on interactive systems that use speech. I am currently interested in the following problems:

Implicit Learning : Human-computer interaction generates information that the system could use to modify its behavior. For example, a speech recognition error that is repaired leaves information about a misclassification that could be used to improve subsequent accuracy. Exploiting such situations (and in fact contriving to create them) can provide a rich set of experiences that drive self-improving systems

Automatic detection and recovery from error: Humans easily detect and recover from breakdowns in communication. Automatic systems are less successful at this, however we can use features of recognition, understanding and dialog to predict the likelihood of misunderstanding at a given point in an interaction, and then apply heuristic strategies for guiding the conversation back onto track.

Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (Misp) 2022 Challenge: Audio-Visual Diarization And Recognition
Year: 2023
Abstract: The Multi-modal Information based Speech Processing (MISP) challenge aims to extend the application of signal processing technology in specific scenarios by promoting the research into wake-up words, speaker diarization, speech recognition, and other technologies. The MISP2022 challenge has two tracks: 1) audio-visual speaker diarization (AVSD), aiming to solve ""who spoken when"" using both audio and visual data; 2) a novel audio-visual diarization and recognition (AVDR) task that focuses on addressing ""who spoken what when"" with audio-visual speaker diarization results. Both tracks focus on the Chinese language, and use far-field audio and video in real home-tv scenarios: 2-6 people communicating each other with TV noise in the background. This paper introduces the dataset, track settings, and baselines of the MISP2022 challenge.

Research
I am interested in artificial intelligence and its application to real-world problems. Over the years, I have worked in many areas of AI, including knowledge representation, planning, image processing, machine learning, massively parallel approaches to search and inference, and the development of improved learning algorithms for artificial neural networks.
My current project is Scone, an open-source knowledge representation system and inference engine that can be used as a component in a variety of knowledge-based systems. Scone puts particular emphasis on efficiency, scalability (up to millions of entities and statements) and ease of use. One goal of our research is to support natural-language understanding, all the way from text or speech to a language-independent representation that we can reason about. This requires extensive use of background knowledge not included in the text itself. We are also working to extend Scone's capabilities for ""episodic"" representation and reasoning, by which we mean actions, events, sequences of actions, plans, goals and explanations.

Title: SPAE: Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder (SPAE) for enabling frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-linguistic modalities such as images or videos. SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%.

Title: HomeRobot: Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation
Year: 2023
Abstract: HomeRobot (noun): An affordable compliant robot that navigates homes and manipulates a wide range of objects in order to complete everyday tasks. Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) is the problem of picking any object in any unseen environment, and placing it in a commanded location. This is a foundational challenge for robots to be useful assistants in human environments, because it involves tackling sub-problems from across robotics: perception, language understanding, navigation, and manipulation are all essential to OVMM. In addition, integration of the solutions to these sub-problems poses its own substantial challenges. To drive research in this area, we introduce the HomeRobot OVMM benchmark, where an agent navigates household environments to grasp novel objects and place them on target receptacles.

Title: MOSAIC: Learning Unified Multi-Sensory Object Property Representations for Robot Perception
Year: 2023
Abstract: A holistic understanding of object properties across diverse sensory modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and haptic) is essential for tasks ranging from object categorization to complex manipulation. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science studies that emphasize the significance of multi-sensory integration in human perception, we introduce MOSAIC (Multimodal Object property learning with Self-Attention and Interactive Comprehension), a novel framework designed to facilitate the learning of unified multi-sensory object property representations. While it is undeniable that visual information plays a prominent role, we acknowledge that many fundamental object properties extend beyond the visual domain to encompass attributes like texture, mass distribution, or sounds, which significantly influence how we interact with objects. In MOSAIC, we leverage this profound insight by distilling knowledge from multimodal foundation models and aligning these representations not only across vision but also haptic and auditory sensory modalities.

Abstract: The entities that emerge during a conversation can be used to model topics, but not all entities are equally useful for this task. Modeling the conversation with entity graphs and predicting each entity's centrality in the conversation provides additional information that improves the retrieval of answer passages for the current question. Experiments show that using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs improves top precision answer passage ranking over competitive transformer-based baselines.

Title: KALE: Using a K-Sparse Projector for Lexical Expansion
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent research has proposed retrieval approaches based on sparse representations and inverted indexes, with terms produced by neural language models and leveraging the advantages from both neural retrieval and lexical matching. This paper proposes KALE, a new lightweight method of this family that uses a small model with a k-sparse projector to convert dense representations into a sparse set of entries from a latent vocabulary. The KALE vocabulary captures semantic concepts than perform well when used in isolation, and perform better when extending the original lexical vocabulary, this way improving first-stage retrieval accuracy. Experiments with the MSMARCOv1 passage retrieval dataset, the TREC Deep Learning dataset, and BEIR datasets, examined the effectiveness of KALE under varying conditions. Results show that the KALE terms can replace the original lexical vocabulary, with gains in accuracy and efficiency.

Title: CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms
Year: 2023
Abstract: Lexical exact-match systems perform text retrieval efficiently with sparse matching signals and fast retrieval through inverted lists, but naturally suffer from the mismatch between lexical surface form and implicit term semantics. This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF). Each CSF pairs a lexical surface form with a context source, and is represented by a lexical form weight and a contextualized semantic vector representation. This framework is able to perform sparse lexicon-based retrieval by learning to represent each query and document as a ""bag-of-CSFs"", simultaneously addressing two key factors in sparse retrieval: vocabulary expansion of surface form and semantic representation of term meaning. At retrieval time, it efficiently matches CSFs through exact-match of learned surface forms, and effectively scores each CSF pair via contextual semantic representations, leading to joint improvement in both term match and term scoring.

Title: Large Language Models Enable Few-Shot Clustering
Year: 2023
Abstract: Unlike traditional unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised clustering allows users to provide meaningful structure to the data, which helps the clustering algorithm to match the user's intent. Existing approaches to semi-supervised clustering require a significant amount of feedback from an expert to improve the clusters. In this paper, we ask whether a large language model can amplify an expert's guidance to enable query-efficient, few-shot semi-supervised text clustering. We show that LLMs are surprisingly effective at improving clustering. We explore three stages where LLMs can be incorporated into clustering: before clustering (improving input features), during clustering (by providing constraints to the clusterer), and after clustering (using LLMs post-correction). We find incorporating LLMs in the first two stages can routinely provide significant improvements in cluster quality, and that LLMs enable a user to make trade-offs between cost and accuracy to produce desired clusters.

Title: Pre-vaccination CD56 dimCD16 +NK cell abundance and T h1/T h17 ratio predict responsiveness to conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in older adults
Year: 2023
Abstract: 
 Older adults are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) infections. There are two available vaccines for pneumococcus: T-cell-independent capsular polysaccharide Pneumovax and T-cell-dependent conjugated Prevnar. However, how older adults respond to these vaccines at the cellular level and whether there are baseline predictors for responsiveness, is not known. To address this, we recruited older adults (60+ yrs), who are vaccinated with Prevnar (n=19) or Pneumovax (n=20). Vaccine responsiveness was quantified using opsonophagocytic assays, which revealed that both vaccines induce strong responses. Interestingly, sex was associated with Prevnar responses, where women mounted stronger responses than men.
