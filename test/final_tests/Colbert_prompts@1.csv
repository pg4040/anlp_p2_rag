Title: Fairness Through Domain Awareness: Mitigating Popularity Bias For Music Discovery
Year: 2023
Abstract: As online music platforms grow, music recommender systems play a vital role in helping users navigate and discover content within their vast musical databases. At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias, which causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially more relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic relationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this issue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which addresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender systems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth listening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should be reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful music discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music domain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing recommendations at both the playlist level and user level.

Research
I am interested in artificial intelligence and its application to real-world problems. Over the years, I have worked in many areas of AI, including knowledge representation, planning, image processing, machine learning, massively parallel approaches to search and inference, and the development of improved learning algorithms for artificial neural networks.
My current project is Scone, an open-source knowledge representation system and inference engine that can be used as a component in a variety of knowledge-based systems. Scone puts particular emphasis on efficiency, scalability (up to millions of entities and statements) and ease of use. One goal of our research is to support natural-language understanding, all the way from text or speech to a language-independent representation that we can reason about. This requires extensive use of background knowledge not included in the text itself. We are also working to extend Scone's capabilities for ""episodic"" representation and reasoning, by which we mean actions, events, sequences of actions, plans, goals and explanations.

Research
My research centers on interactive systems that use speech. I am currently interested in the following problems:

Implicit Learning : Human-computer interaction generates information that the system could use to modify its behavior. For example, a speech recognition error that is repaired leaves information about a misclassification that could be used to improve subsequent accuracy. Exploiting such situations (and in fact contriving to create them) can provide a rich set of experiences that drive self-improving systems

Automatic detection and recovery from error: Humans easily detect and recover from breakdowns in communication. Automatic systems are less successful at this, however we can use features of recognition, understanding and dialog to predict the likelihood of misunderstanding at a given point in an interaction, and then apply heuristic strategies for guiding the conversation back onto track.

My research is concerned with language and its role in human communication. In particular, my long-term research goal is to break down barriers in human-human or human-machine communication through the development of natural language processing (NLP) technologies. This includes the development of technology for machine translation, which helps break down barriers in communication for people who speak different languages, and natural language understanding, which helps computers understand and respond to human language. Within this overall goal of breaking down barriers to human communication, I have focused on several aspects of language that both make it interesting as a scientific subject, and hold potential for the construction of practical systems.

Advances in core NLP technology: Human language is complex and nuanced, and handling this complexity in a computational way requires sophisticated algorithms or learning techniques, the development of which is far from a solved problem. The first major area of my work focuses on advances in core NLP technology, which improve the accuracy with which we can analyze, translate, generate, or reply to textual inputs.

Title: Solving NLP Problems through Human-System Collaboration: A Discussion-based Approach
Year: 2023
Abstract: Humans work together to solve common problems by having discussions, explaining, and agreeing or disagreeing with each other. Similarly, if a system can have discussions with humans when solving tasks, it can improve the system's performance and reliability. In previous research on explainability, it has only been possible for the system to make predictions and for humans to ask questions about them rather than having a mutual exchange of opinions. This research aims to create a dataset and computational framework for systems that discuss and refine their predictions through dialogue. Through experiments, we show that the proposed system can have beneficial discussions with humans improving the accuracy by up to 25 points in the natural language inference task.

Research
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, computational linguistics and signal processing — building the computational foundations to enable computers with the abilities to analyze, recognize and predict subtle human communicative behaviors during social interactions. Human face-to-face communication is a little like a dance: participants continuously adjust their behaviors based on their interlocutor’s speech, gestures and facial expressions during social interaction. The actual sophistication of human communication comes to the fore when we try to create computers that can understand and participate, however crudely, in this type of social interaction.

Question: What models did Morency create?
Context: These energy-based probabilistic models must address core computational issues with human communication dynamics, including hierarchical and nonlinear feature representation, multiview learning and potential over fitting on smaller training sets. For example, I created a family of latent probabilistic models (HCRF, LDCRF, CCNF, etc.) designed to automatically learn the hidden dynamics present in human verbal and nonverbal communication.

Health Behavior Informatics
This research has many applications in education (learning analytics), business (negotiation, interpersonal skills training) and social multimedia (opinion mining, social influence). One area I am particularly excited about is the development of new decision support tools for healthcare applications. For example, how can we quantify, analyze and summarize patient verbal and nonverbal behaviors during psychotherapy? This information could not only help clinicians between therapy sessions but also facilitate collaboration with other medical team members by providing objective behavior measures for the patient’s medical record.

Title: Language Models Get a Gender Makeover: Mitigating Gender Bias with Few-Shot Data Interventions
Year: 2023
Abstract: Societal biases present in pre-trained large language models are a critical issue as these models have been shown to propagate biases in countless downstream applications, rendering them unfair towards specific groups of people. Since large-scale retraining of these models from scratch is both time and compute-expensive, a variety of approaches have been previously proposed that de-bias a pre-trained model. While the majority of current state-of-the-art debiasing methods focus on changes to the training regime, in this paper, we propose data intervention strategies as a powerful yet simple technique to reduce gender bias in pre-trained models. Specifically, we empirically show that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 debiased (intervened) training examples, the tendency to favor any gender is significantly reduced.

I am interested in artificial intelligence and its application to real-world problems. Over the years, I have worked in many areas of AI, including knowledge representation, planning, image processing, machine learning, massively parallel approaches to search and inference, and the development of improved learning algorithms for artificial neural networks.
My current project is Scone, an open-source knowledge representation system and inference engine that can be used as a component in a variety of knowledge-based systems. Scone puts particular emphasis on efficiency, scalability (up to millions of entities and statements) and ease of use. One goal of our research is to support natural-language understanding, all the way from text or speech to a language-independent representation that we can reason about. This requires extensive use of background knowledge not included in the text itself. We are also working to extend Scone's capabilities for ""episodic"" representation and reasoning, by which we mean actions, events, sequences of actions, plans, goals and explanations.

Title: SPAE: Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder (SPAE) for enabling frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-linguistic modalities such as images or videos. SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%.

Title: MOSAIC: Learning Unified Multi-Sensory Object Property Representations for Robot Perception
Year: 2023
Abstract: A holistic understanding of object properties across diverse sensory modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and haptic) is essential for tasks ranging from object categorization to complex manipulation. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science studies that emphasize the significance of multi-sensory integration in human perception, we introduce MOSAIC (Multimodal Object property learning with Self-Attention and Interactive Comprehension), a novel framework designed to facilitate the learning of unified multi-sensory object property representations. While it is undeniable that visual information plays a prominent role, we acknowledge that many fundamental object properties extend beyond the visual domain to encompass attributes like texture, mass distribution, or sounds, which significantly influence how we interact with objects. In MOSAIC, we leverage this profound insight by distilling knowledge from multimodal foundation models and aligning these representations not only across vision but also haptic and auditory sensory modalities.

Title: KALE: Using a K-Sparse Projector for Lexical Expansion
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent research has proposed retrieval approaches based on sparse representations and inverted indexes, with terms produced by neural language models and leveraging the advantages from both neural retrieval and lexical matching. This paper proposes KALE, a new lightweight method of this family that uses a small model with a k-sparse projector to convert dense representations into a sparse set of entries from a latent vocabulary. The KALE vocabulary captures semantic concepts than perform well when used in isolation, and perform better when extending the original lexical vocabulary, this way improving first-stage retrieval accuracy. Experiments with the MSMARCOv1 passage retrieval dataset, the TREC Deep Learning dataset, and BEIR datasets, examined the effectiveness of KALE under varying conditions. Results show that the KALE terms can replace the original lexical vocabulary, with gains in accuracy and efficiency.

Title: Large Language Models Enable Few-Shot Clustering
Year: 2023
Abstract: Unlike traditional unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised clustering allows users to provide meaningful structure to the data, which helps the clustering algorithm to match the user's intent. Existing approaches to semi-supervised clustering require a significant amount of feedback from an expert to improve the clusters. In this paper, we ask whether a large language model can amplify an expert's guidance to enable query-efficient, few-shot semi-supervised text clustering. We show that LLMs are surprisingly effective at improving clustering. We explore three stages where LLMs can be incorporated into clustering: before clustering (improving input features), during clustering (by providing constraints to the clusterer), and after clustering (using LLMs post-correction). We find incorporating LLMs in the first two stages can routinely provide significant improvements in cluster quality, and that LLMs enable a user to make trade-offs between cost and accuracy to produce desired clusters.

Year: 2023
Abstract: The DialDoc 2023 shared task has expanded the document-grounded dialogue task to encompass multiple languages, despite having limited annotated data. This paper assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained transformer models in a bi-encoder-based dense passage retriever (DPR), concluding that the language-agnostic approach is superior. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of query rewriting techniques using large language models, such as ChatGPT, on multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems. The experiments conducted demonstrate that, for the examples examined, query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries. This failure is due to topic switching in final dialogue turns and irrelevant topics being considered for query rewriting.

Title: Pre-vaccination CD56 dimCD16 +NK cell abundance and T h1/T h17 ratio predict responsiveness to conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in older adults
Year: 2023
Abstract: 
 Older adults are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) infections. There are two available vaccines for pneumococcus: T-cell-independent capsular polysaccharide Pneumovax and T-cell-dependent conjugated Prevnar. However, how older adults respond to these vaccines at the cellular level and whether there are baseline predictors for responsiveness, is not known. To address this, we recruited older adults (60+ yrs), who are vaccinated with Prevnar (n=19) or Pneumovax (n=20). Vaccine responsiveness was quantified using opsonophagocytic assays, which revealed that both vaccines induce strong responses. Interestingly, sex was associated with Prevnar responses, where women mounted stronger responses than men.
