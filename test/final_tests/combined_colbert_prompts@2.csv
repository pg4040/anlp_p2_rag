Context: 25 Great Things About SCS | SCS25 - Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science Skip to main content Legal Events Register 25 Things History Video 25 Great Things About SCS What’s so great about computer science at Carnegie Mellon?We're glad you asked! Here are 25 great ideas from CMU computer scientists to think about as we celebrate the birthday of the School of Computer Science.1. Artificial intelligence, 1955-56 Can you write a working computer program without a computer? Herb Simon (H’90), at left, Allen Newell (IA’57), at right, and Cliff Shaw did. The team created the first artificial intelligence program, Logic Theorist, which could solve logic puzzles in the same way that a human might solve them. Newell demonstrated that it worked by writing the instructions on 3-by-5 index cards that were manipulated on the kitchen table by Newell, his wife, and a group of Carnegie Tech grad students. 2. Multi-core processors, 1971 Multi-core processors are common in today’s computers, but they were still science fiction in the early 1970s. But when CMU researchers found their existing machines too slow to keep pace with the advance of speech and graphics programs, they knew they had to do something. They solved the problem by ganging together 16 processors to build a pioneering computer called C.mmp—then topped the feat by linking 50 processors into Cm*. 3. Tutoring machines, 1973Games and drills, such as flash cards, have long been used to help students learn tough subjects. But the cognitive tutoring programs developed at Carnegie Mellon, beginning in the 1970s, did more than simply drill students on math problems. Cognitive tutors were able to adapt, presenting harder or easier problems as students learned or stumbled. Today, cognitive tutors teach subjects such as algebra to hundreds of thousands of students every year. 4. Speech recognition, 1976If you have an iPhone, ask Siri to look up “Hearsay I,” the first computer system capable of continuous speech recognition. It was developed by future Turing Award winner and future SCS dean Raj Reddy along with his students. Their work on subsequent systems established many of the principles that still underlie speech recognition software. 5.

Question: Which researchers developed a logic puzzle solving AI program and demonstrarted on 3-by-5 index cards?
Context: GPT-3.5-Turbo Assessment: 1. Assess the Potential: This prompt is an excellent test of the AI’s problem-solving skills. It requires the AI to perform calculations and find a solution that satisfies the given conditions. The AI needs to determine the number of apples and oranges to buy in order to achieve a 50/50 ratio, given the initial quantities and the total number of fruits to be bought. 2. Assign a Score: This prompt has a high potential to assess the AI’s problem-solving skills effectively. It requires logical thinking and mathematical calculations. Therefore, I would assign a score of [[9]]. Arena User Vote: GPT-4 is better. The correct answer is you need to buy 1500 apples and 3000 oranges. The final number of apples and oranges is 5500. Here, GPT-3.5-Turbo incorrectly states the final number of apple is 5000 and orange is 3500. On the other hand, GPT-4 is correct. Example 3: An example of a good prompt for evaluating an AI assistant’s performance on challenging benchmark questions. This sample is taken from conversations in LMSYS-Chat-1M.

Question: The students of which CMU professor were involved in the development of IBM Watson?
Context: An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life. 21. RNA sequencing via videogames, 2010 Thanks to crowdsourcing, science isn’t just for scientists any more. People without formal training in molecular biology are producing new insights into genetic encoding through a videogame called EteRNA, developed by researchers at CMU and Stanford, that allows players to fold and shift RNA molecules to solve on-screen puzzles. 22. Language learning software, 2010Learning a second language has always been challenging, but a CMU spinoff called Duolingo is proving that it doesn’t have to be expensive. Duolingo has developed language tutoring software that enables users to learn Spanish, English, Italian, German, Portuguese or French for free through its website and mobile apps. In the process, Duolingo users are helping to translate the Web. 23. Question-answering computers, 2011 Searching the Web for information is rarely as simple as asking a question in plain English. So-called “question-answering” machines moved from laboratories to TV screens when an IBM computer called “Watson” defeated two human champions on the game show “Jeopardy!” At the heart of Watson was computer architecture developed by CMU’s Eric Nyberg and his students. 24. Encrypting online information, 2012 Credit card numbers and other data used online is safer thanks to an encryption scheme developed by CMU alumna Shafi Goldwasser (S’79). She shared the 2012 Turing Award for her role in developing practical encoding schemes that are difficult to break. 25. Smart, adaptable traffic signals, 2012 Smart traffic lights developed at CMU’s Robotics Institute are saving time and energy, and cutting down on the amount of air pollution created by idling cars. First rolled out in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood, the new signals are being studied around the country.
The experiment, which lasted two years, was an unqualified success. Separately, and also in 1986, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center was created as a joint effort between CMU, the University of Pittsburgh and Westinghouse Electric Corp.SCS is officially formedCMU’s Faculty Senate in the fall of 1988 agreed to President Richard Cyert’s plan to elevate the Department of Computer Science to college status. In addition to the Computer Science Department, SCS also incorporated the Robotics Institute, the Center for Machine Translation, and researchers from the Information Technology Center, which had developed Andrew. On Dec. 13, 1988, Cyert (H’89) told faculty and staff that Habermann had been appointed CMU’s first Dean of Computer Science, effective Dec. 1, and that the School of Computer Science would soon begin operations. SCS made its formal debut on Dec. 22, 1988, with a reception in the Wherrett Room of Skibo Hall, CMU’s student union. The official announcement of CMU’s new “graduate School of Computer Science” was made Jan. 3, 1989.Undergraduate degrees beginFor several years, undergraduates interested in computer science pursued an “applied math/CS” bachelor’s degree offered by the Mathematics Department. CSD professor Mary Shaw (CS’72) led CMU’s first effort to design an undergraduate curriculum solely in computer science. She and her colleagues were guided by the Carnegie Plan—guidelines established in 1938 under Carnegie Tech President Robert Doherty (A’40, E’48, H’50), outlining the principles of a sound professional education. Drawing on Shaw’s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990–91.

Question: Which CMU alumna was an awardee of the Turing Award in 2012?
Context: Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking. 16. CAPTCHAs, 2000 “Spam” and malicious attacks were a growing problem on the Internet when hackers developed automated “bots” that could sign up for email and other Web services without human intervention. Luis von Ahn (CS’03,’05), Nick Hopper (CS’04), John Langford (CS’02) and CMU professor Manuel Blum invented a “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” or CAPTCHA, to help foil the bots. A later variation, reCAPTCHA, is helping digitize old books and newspapers. 17. Robotic video cameras, 2001When Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent Dilfer dropped back to pass, TV viewers of Super Bowl XXXV saw something they’d never seen before --- the motion froze and the view suddenly rotated to show Dilfer’s opposite side. CBS called it Eyevision. The synchronized system of robotic cameras and advanced image processing was the brainchild of CMU’s Takeo Kanade, one of many advances he pioneered in computer vision. 18. Self-driving vehicles, 2007Carnegie Mellon’s early attempts at self-driving vehicles progressed slowly, creeping around Pittsburgh’s Schenley Park in the late 1990s. But they were going full-throttle by the time CMU’s self-driving SUV, named BOSS, won the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge road race. 19. Thought reading programs, 2007Your brain reacts in different ways, depending on what words you’re thinking about --- ways that are measurable with magnetic-resonance imaging, or MRI, machines. CMU researchers Tom Mitchell and Marcel Just are decoding those brain scans and are making progress at reading people’s thoughts. 20. Kidney donor matching, 2008 Organ transplants save lives every day, but more people could likely be saved if it was easier to match recipients with donors who are unrelated.

An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life. 21. RNA sequencing via videogames, 2010 Thanks to crowdsourcing, science isn’t just for scientists any more. People without formal training in molecular biology are producing new insights into genetic encoding through a videogame called EteRNA, developed by researchers at CMU and Stanford, that allows players to fold and shift RNA molecules to solve on-screen puzzles. 22. Language learning software, 2010Learning a second language has always been challenging, but a CMU spinoff called Duolingo is proving that it doesn’t have to be expensive. Duolingo has developed language tutoring software that enables users to learn Spanish, English, Italian, German, Portuguese or French for free through its website and mobile apps. In the process, Duolingo users are helping to translate the Web. 23. Question-answering computers, 2011 Searching the Web for information is rarely as simple as asking a question in plain English. So-called “question-answering” machines moved from laboratories to TV screens when an IBM computer called “Watson” defeated two human champions on the game show “Jeopardy!” At the heart of Watson was computer architecture developed by CMU’s Eric Nyberg and his students. 24. Encrypting online information, 2012 Credit card numbers and other data used online is safer thanks to an encryption scheme developed by CMU alumna Shafi Goldwasser (S’79). She shared the 2012 Turing Award for her role in developing practical encoding schemes that are difficult to break. 25. Smart, adaptable traffic signals, 2012 Smart traffic lights developed at CMU’s Robotics Institute are saving time and energy, and cutting down on the amount of air pollution created by idling cars. First rolled out in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood, the new signals are being studied around the country.

It was arguably the first college devoted solely to computer science in the United States, and a model for others that followed. But CMU’s computer science era begins much earlier—in 1956, with the arrival of an IBM 650 computer on the campus of what was then known as Carnegie Institute of Technology. The IBM 650 had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Simon (H’90), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration—now known as CMU’s Tepper School of Business—established Carnegie Tech’s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S’42).First freshman-level computer science courseIn 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA’57) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work. They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term “computer science” as “the theory and design of computers,” as well as (in Newell’s words) “the study of the phenomena arising from them.” In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.Computer science Ph.D. program createdIn 1961, the Computation Center and its newest computer, a Bendix G-20, were moved to recently completed Scaife Hall. That same year, Carnegie Tech created an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program called Systems and Communications Sciences, combining elements of computer science, mathematics, psychology, business and electrical engineering. The university’s first computer science Ph.D.s were graduates of this program.Computer Science Department establishedIn 1965, Carnegie Tech established its Computer Science Department, or CSD, with a $5 million grant from the R.K. Mellon Foundation.
As the 1970s progressed, Newell became interested in human-computer interaction, and began a long relationship with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, which released the Xerox Alto in 1973. Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU’s own “three-M” machine—a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.Launching a Robotics InstituteIn 1979, an executive at Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric Corp., Tom Murrin, collaborated with Jordan and Reddy to create the Robotics Institute, with Reddy as its first director. By 1982, the Computer Science Department included more than 30 faculty members and 100 graduate students.The best-wired campus in the worldWorking with IBM in the early 1980s, the university and the Computer Science Department established another new research frontier: Development of a high-speed computer network that would reach virtually every room on campus, along with a GUI-based computing environment, and providing networked PCs or workstations for 7,000 students, faculty members and employees. Called the Andrew Project, it turned Carnegie Mellon into the best-connected, most-wired university in the world—a process Newell called “greening up the campus with computer science.” CMU also became home to a new Software Engineering Institute, funded by the Defense Department, to study computer security and develop best practices in the design of operating systems. Between 1982 and 1985, the amount of sponsored research in the Computer Science Department doubled, from $7.2 million to $15.3 million—more than the other four departments in the Mellon College of Science combined.A “school of computer science” is proposedFeeling that CSD’s needs were inadequately represented in MCS, CSD head A. Nico Habermann and then-CMU provost Angel Jordan in 1986 wrote a white paper proposing the creation of “a School of Computer Science.” Responding to concerns from the faculty that the change might be taking place too quickly, the university first established a free-floating Department of Computer Science. The experiment, which lasted two years, was an unqualified success.

Multimodal Computing and Interaction, Speech Processing, Spoken Interfaces and Dialogue Processing

Research
My research centers on interactive systems that use speech. I am currently interested in the following problems:

Implicit Learning : Human-computer interaction generates information that the system could use to modify its behavior. For example, a speech recognition error that is repaired leaves information about a misclassification that could be used to improve subsequent accuracy. Exploiting such situations (and in fact contriving to create them) can provide a rich set of experiences that drive self-improving systems

Automatic detection and recovery from error: Humans easily detect and recover from breakdowns in communication. Automatic systems are less successful at this, however we can use features of recognition, understanding and dialog to predict the likelihood of misunderstanding at a given point in an interaction, and then apply heuristic strategies for guiding the conversation back onto track.

A theory of language design for speech-based interactive systems: Speech-mode communication predisposes the user to make certain word choices and to exhibit certain grammatical preferences. An understanding of the principles that underlie these preferences (and how these can be influenced by the system's language) leads to better language design for interactive systems.

The role of speech in the computer interface: Speech is an effective means of communication, but it is not always suitable for all types of interaction. Ideally we can analyze an interface in terms of the task(s) it will be used for, the costs of specific interactions and the value perceived by the user. To date we've studied models based on time, system error and task structure. These models turn out to be useful for simple systems and appear to be extensible to more complex systems. Many of these issues are being explored in the context of working systems, for example a language interface for a team of humans and robots working together (Treasure Hunt) or a information access for conferences (ConQuest) or for scheduling court time (Let’s Play).

There were no undergraduates; only Ph.D. students were admitted, and the department’s focus was on research, much of it funded by the federal government through the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In 1967, Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the nearby Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to form Carnegie-Mellon University. The Department of Computer Science moved into the newly created Mellon Institute of Science, later renamed Mellon College of Science, or MCS. Future SCS dean Raj Reddy joined the CSD in 1969 after three years as an assistant professor at Stanford. He brought with him research in speech, language and computer vision. But in 1970 and 1971, the new Computer Science Department faced its first crisis, as half of its tenured faculty members—including department head Perlis—left for other universities. Joe Traub was recruited from Bell Labs to CMU to become the new department head.Multi-processor machines emergeCSD emerged from the brief crisis as a highly agile, interdisciplinary entity, with many new faculty members taking joint appointments with other CMU departments. Several large projects emerged in the Computer Science Department, including C.mmp, the first shared-memory multiprocessor computer, with 16 processing units, and Cm*, a 50-processor computer. These computers were the forerunners of today’s ubiquitous multi-core desktops and laptops.Turing Awards and a Nobel PrizeIn 1975, Simon and Newell were awarded the A.M. Turing Award for their work in artificial intelligence. (As of 2014, 12 CMU alumni or faculty have been awarded Turings, sometimes considered the Nobel Prize of computing.)

In addition to the Computer Science Department, SCS also incorporated the Robotics Institute, the Center for Machine Translation, and researchers from the Information Technology Center, which had developed Andrew. On Dec. 13, 1988, Cyert (H’89) told faculty and staff that Habermann had been appointed CMU’s first Dean of Computer Science, effective Dec. 1, and that the School of Computer Science would soon begin operations. SCS made its formal debut on Dec. 22, 1988, with a reception in the Wherrett Room of Skibo Hall, CMU’s student union. The official announcement of CMU’s new “graduate School of Computer Science” was made Jan. 3, 1989.Undergraduate degrees beginFor several years, undergraduates interested in computer science pursued an “applied math/CS” bachelor’s degree offered by the Mathematics Department. CSD professor Mary Shaw (CS’72) led CMU’s first effort to design an undergraduate curriculum solely in computer science. She and her colleagues were guided by the Carnegie Plan—guidelines established in 1938 under Carnegie Tech President Robert Doherty (A’40, E’48, H’50), outlining the principles of a sound professional education. Drawing on Shaw’s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990–91.

Considered a forerunner to many of the computing environments that followed, Alto featured a graphical-user interface and was among the first commercially available workstations controlled with a mouse. Inspired by Alto, Reddy launched a drive for development of CMU’s own “three-M” machine—a personal workstation with a megabyte of memory, a megapixel display and at least one million instructions per second of processing power.Launching a Robotics InstituteIn 1979, an executive at Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric Corp., Tom Murrin, collaborated with Jordan and Reddy to create the Robotics Institute, with Reddy as its first director. By 1982, the Computer Science Department included more than 30 faculty members and 100 graduate students.The best-wired campus in the worldWorking with IBM in the early 1980s, the university and the Computer Science Department established another new research frontier: Development of a high-speed computer network that would reach virtually every room on campus, along with a GUI-based computing environment, and providing networked PCs or workstations for 7,000 students, faculty members and employees. Called the Andrew Project, it turned Carnegie Mellon into the best-connected, most-wired university in the world—a process Newell called “greening up the campus with computer science.” CMU also became home to a new Software Engineering Institute, funded by the Defense Department, to study computer security and develop best practices in the design of operating systems. Between 1982 and 1985, the amount of sponsored research in the Computer Science Department doubled, from $7.2 million to $15.3 million—more than the other four departments in the Mellon College of Science combined.A “school of computer science” is proposedFeeling that CSD’s needs were inadequately represented in MCS, CSD head A. Nico Habermann and then-CMU provost Angel Jordan in 1986 wrote a white paper proposing the creation of “a School of Computer Science.” Responding to concerns from the faculty that the change might be taking place too quickly, the university first established a free-floating Department of Computer Science. The experiment, which lasted two years, was an unqualified success.

It was arguably the first college devoted solely to computer science in the United States, and a model for others that followed. But CMU’s computer science era begins much earlier—in 1956, with the arrival of an IBM 650 computer on the campus of what was then known as Carnegie Institute of Technology. The IBM 650 had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Simon (H’90), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration—now known as CMU’s Tepper School of Business—established Carnegie Tech’s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S’42).First freshman-level computer science courseIn 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA’57) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work. They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term “computer science” as “the theory and design of computers,” as well as (in Newell’s words) “the study of the phenomena arising from them.” In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech.Computer science Ph.D. program createdIn 1961, the Computation Center and its newest computer, a Bendix G-20, were moved to recently completed Scaife Hall. That same year, Carnegie Tech created an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program called Systems and Communications Sciences, combining elements of computer science, mathematics, psychology, business and electrical engineering. The university’s first computer science Ph.D.s were graduates of this program.Computer Science Department establishedIn 1965, Carnegie Tech established its Computer Science Department, or CSD, with a $5 million grant from the R.K.

The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China.

Question: Mellon family facilitated the creation of how many new colleges?
Context: Drawing on Shaw’s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990–91. By 1995, there were 401 undergraduates in the School of Computer Science; in fall 2013, more than 600 undergraduates made up about 37 percent of student enrollment at SCS, along with more than 600 master’s degree students.New departments, new areas of studyAlong the way, the Center for Machine Translation became the Language Technologies Institute, and other new departments were formed, including the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (1993), the Institute for Software Research (1999), the Machine Learning Department (2006) and the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology (2009). SCS’s seven degree-granting departments draw faculty and students from a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, social sciences, linguistics and design.Committed to extending our founders’ visionThe School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University enters its second quarter century as a world-leading educational and research institution, embracing all facets of computing. Its graduate programs are consisted ranked with the best in the world by a leading U.S. magazine, while its undergraduate programs are also rated the best in the U.S. by corporate recruiters. In 2013, SCS had 284 faculty members and a total student enrollment of nearly 1,700, including undergraduate, master’s and Ph.D. students, and conducted $124 million in research. Indeed, by itself, the Robotics Institute is the largest university robotics research group in the world, with more than 500 people and more than 100 ongoing research projects. A half-century ago, Perlis, Simon and Newell outlined a vision for computer science. The School of Computer Science at CMU remains committed to continuing and extending their vision in the context of big data and connected computing in the 21st century.

A.1.8 Language and Cross-Cultural Support 
More than 60% of graduate students at Carnegie Mellon are international students, and others 
are nonnative speakers of English who have attended high school or undergraduate programs 
in the US. Many of these students want to hone their language and cross-cultural skills for 
academic and professional success. Students can choose from sessions on: 
 how to give a strong presentation 
 writing academic emails 
 expectations and strategies for clear academic writing 
 how to talk about yourself as a professional in the U.S. 
 developing clearer pronunciation 
 using accurate grammar 
 building fluency, and more. 
Students can make an appointment with a Language Development Specialist to get 
individualized coaching on language or cross-cultural issues.  
The Student Academic Success Center is also charged with certifying the language of 
International Teaching Assistants (ITAs), ensuring that nonnative English speakers have the 
language proficiency needed to succeed as teaching assistants in the Carnegie Mellon 
classroom.

Question: What is another name for buggy races?
Context: An mural celebrating Buggy can be found in CMU's Stever House. The artwork is part of a larger installation showcasing Sweepstakes and its traditions. Sweepstakes Slang Buggy: Vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the competition. Chute: A section of the freeroll portion of the buggy course (near the southwestern end of Frew Street at its intersection with Schenley Drive) where buggies make the sharp righthand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street. Chute Flagger: Team member who provides a signal for buggy drivers to know when to start the right-hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street. Driver: Person who travels with a buggy and controls the vehicles via steering and braking systems. Pushbar: Structure attached to a buggy that a person pushes to propel that buggy forward. Pusher: Person who propels a buggy via a pushbar along one of the five hills of the buggy course. Shell: Entire outer structure or covering of a buggy that determines that buggy's aerodynamic characteristics. Transition: Procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy. Members of Fringe, celebrating their 50th year of Buggy racing, allowed a rare visit into its shop for a behind-the-scenes tour. This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the ""Froom."" ""We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused,"" said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering. Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter ""B,"" like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice. This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.

The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago. Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill. But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing. The Machine The basics of a buggy are straightforward, but teams are often secretive in how they build the machines, in particular the way they brake, steer and what types of wheels are used. Each has a body, pushbar for runners to move the machine up the hills, wheels, a safety harness and driving and braking mechanisms. Some also include fairings, a type of housing around the wheels that help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter and just looks cool. Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy. ""We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course,"" said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing.

Behind the Wheel Drivers, have the closest connection to the vehicles, aside from the mechanics who spent countless hours building and maintaining individual buggies. While races are brief, each driver must log a number of practice runs to qualify to race. Teams practice nights and weekends throughout the fall and spring semesters as weather permits. Buggies are often built around drivers, so the fit can be snug, and drivers are often less than 5 feet, 3 inches in height. Most — but not all — are women. Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes. ""Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything,"" Girdhar said. ""But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."" Amy Chen demonstrates how a driver is positioned inside of Boson, a Fringe buggy built in 2016. Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed. The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.

The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago. Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill. But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing. The Machine The basics of a buggy are straightforward, but teams are often secretive in how they build the machines, in particular the way they brake, steer and what types of wheels are used. Each has a body, pushbar for runners to move the machine up the hills, wheels, a safety harness and driving and braking mechanisms. Some also include fairings, a type of housing around the wheels that help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter and just looks cool. Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy. ""We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course,"" said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics. An mural celebrating Buggy can be found in CMU's Stever House.

Question: Is a buggy a vehicle or an utensil?
Context: An mural celebrating Buggy can be found in CMU's Stever House. The artwork is part of a larger installation showcasing Sweepstakes and its traditions. Sweepstakes Slang Buggy: Vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the competition. Chute: A section of the freeroll portion of the buggy course (near the southwestern end of Frew Street at its intersection with Schenley Drive) where buggies make the sharp righthand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street. Chute Flagger: Team member who provides a signal for buggy drivers to know when to start the right-hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street. Driver: Person who travels with a buggy and controls the vehicles via steering and braking systems. Pushbar: Structure attached to a buggy that a person pushes to propel that buggy forward. Pusher: Person who propels a buggy via a pushbar along one of the five hills of the buggy course. Shell: Entire outer structure or covering of a buggy that determines that buggy's aerodynamic characteristics. Transition: Procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy. Members of Fringe, celebrating their 50th year of Buggy racing, allowed a rare visit into its shop for a behind-the-scenes tour. This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the ""Froom."" ""We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused,"" said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering. Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter ""B,"" like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.

The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him. Carnegie Tech - Post-war Years With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms. The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening three new schools: 1948: The Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the David A. Tepper School of Business, focusing on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science. 1968: School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed the H. John Heinz III College, providing graduate training for work in the public sector. 1986: School of Computer Science, pioneering computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon. Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Any 
additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered 
electives. 
 
To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 
course units per semester. A student may not take more than 60 units per 
semester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must 
maintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester. 
3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course 
All MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data 
Science course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a 
grade of “B” or better.  
3.3.5 Plan of study 
The degree consists of two timing options based on the length of time the student spends 
working on the degree. The student chooses their timing at the start of the degree 
program (for visa requirements). Changes in timing are possible with the approval of the 
Director of the degree program and successful visa extension application with CMU’s 
Office of International Education. Note that all degree options consist of the same amount 
of coursework: 
 
 
 
Professional Preparation Track – a 16-month degree consisting of study for Fall 
and Spring semesters, a summer internship, and Fall semester of study. Each 
semester consists of a minimum of 48 units of study. This timing is typical for most 
students. The student graduates in December. 
 
Research Preparation Track – a 20-month degree consisting of study for Fall and 
Spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of Fall and Spring 
study. Each semester consists of a minimum of 36 units of study. This timing is 
designed for students interested in extending their time at CMU for developing 
applied research skills in preparation for further graduate study or research-
oriented employment. Note that the per-semester course load is lower, but the 
total cost is higher since four semesters of tuition are paid. This timing is also 
 
 
15
recommended for students interested in pursuing a PhD after graduation. The 
student graduates in May.

When did Andrew Carnegie come to the US?,"['cmuhistory_d402.txt', 'tartanfacts_d404_metadata.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: When did Andrew Carnegie come to the US?
Context: The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him. Carnegie Tech - Post-war Years With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms. The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening three new schools: 1948: The Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the David A. Tepper School of Business, focusing on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science. 1968: School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed the H. John Heinz III College, providing graduate training for work in the public sector. 1986: School of Computer Science, pioneering computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon. Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Question: Did Andrew Carnegie have a Dandie Dinmont Terrier as a pet?
Context: About Scotty
The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet.
Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church.
The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot.
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.
The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.
The
Scottish terrier breed
is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power and agility in a small package. Many of these traits are also apparent throughout the university, making the Scottish terrier a natural choice for Carnegie Mellon's mascot.

Who founded Carnegie Mellon University?
Carnegie Technical Schools was founded in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie. Twelve years later it became known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology. In 1967, the school merged with Mellon Institute and became what is known today as Carnegie Mellon University.
What is a Tartan?
The Carnegie Mellon athletic teams are nicknamed the ""Tartans"" as a nod to Andrew Carnegie's Scottish heritage. A tartan is often misrepresented as a fierce warrior from either the Asian tundra or Scottish highlands. In actuality, a Tartan is a twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design. It is of Scottish origin and consists of stripes of various colors and widths against a solid ground, denoting a particular family lineage. The school's founder, Andrew Carnegie, was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1835. Carnegie came to the United States in 1848 and founded Carnegie Technical Schools in Pittsburgh in 1900.
The Scottish terrier mascot performer sports Carnegie tartan attire, while the graphic mascot is wearing a plaid scarf around its neck. So what's the difference between tartan and plaid?
You'll know it's a tartan if...
• ""It's a check or pattern in a variety of colours in woven fabric in which bands of colour are repeated in equal proportion in warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across).""
• ""Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection.""
• ""The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft.""
You can find our official tartan on various items in the

Official Mascot?
More than a century after Carnegie Mellon University opened its doors, an official mascot finally made its mark. Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot.
In keeping with tradition, students, faculty, staff and alumni voted to name the new official mascot Scotty. But it's not just the costumed mascot that voters named.

Fun Fact
The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years. With the vehicles just inches from the ground, ""even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive,"" she added. Depending on Friday and Saturday's conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three. But still, despite some of the challenges, Chen said she wouldn't miss it. ""Being a driver is really fun,"" Chen said.

Title: Multi-Objective Improvement of Android Applications
Authors: James, Callan, Justyna Petke
Section: 1 Introduction
parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, no GI work so far has attempted to improve and find trade-offs between multiple properties of Android apps, and no approach has attempted to improve either the memory consumption or bandwidth usage of Android apps, which we target in this work. Previous work on applying GI in the Android domain revealed several practical challenges: 1) due to the complexity of the Android build system and significant use of UI elements, a minor change usually requires a time-costly process of installation on the actual device for testing 2) tests themselves are scarce, and 3) performance fitness measurements used in the desktop domain are not accurate enough to witness performance issues in Android apps, yet users deem wait time of just 150ms as ‘laggy’ (Tolia et al (2006)). We overcome these challenges. We utilise the Robolectric testing library (Robolectric Develop. Team (2023)) which mimics UI behaviour, allowing for quick unit testing, without need for installation on an actual mobile or tablet device. This simulation-based approach provides us with means of utilising performance measurement tools unavailable on Android devices. In order to validate our proposed approach, we created a tool, GIDroid (2023), for running multi-objective (MO) GI on Android applications. We provide three fitness functions, to improve runtime, memory, and bandwidth use. GIDroid contains three MO algorithms (NSGA-II (Deb et al (2000)), NSGA-III (Deb and Jain (2014)), and SPEA2 (Kim et al (2004))). Based on work by Callan et al (2022), who mined nonfunctional improvements made by Android developers, we implement in GIDroid two novel mutation operators, specifically designed to mimic human-made edits. These cache results of repeated calls, aiming to save memory use. When using GI, we validate the patches that we generate using the program’s test suite and validate the best-improving final patches manually. This ensures that our patches do not disrupt the functionality of the program. However, most open-source Android applications do not have test suites, and those that do are limited, achieving a median line coverage of 23% (Pecorelli et al (2020)).

Question: Is Scotty contained in a shield?
Context: About Scotty
The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet.
Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church.
The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot.
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.
The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.
The
Scottish terrier breed
is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power and agility in a small package. Many of these traits are also apparent throughout the university, making the Scottish terrier a natural choice for Carnegie Mellon's mascot.

The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years. With the vehicles just inches from the ground, ""even poorly filled potholes makes it dangerous to drive,"" she added. Depending on Friday and Saturday's conditions, most heats may run just two lanes instead of three. But still, despite some of the challenges, Chen said she wouldn't miss it. ""Being a driver is really fun,"" Chen said.

Question: Which University does Kiltie Band support?
Context: The Kiltie Band
The Kiltie Band began in 1908 with a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football, and today's Kiltie Band continues a tradition of excellence originated over a century ago. The Band took the field for its first official performance on November 25th, 1922, on what would have been Andrew Carnegie's 87th birthday.
The Kiltie Marching Band consists of musicians and colorguard and plays at all Carnegie Mellon home football games. There is a new show every week with music ranging from traditional marches and oldies to current pop tunes and jazz standards.
After football season, the Kiltie Concert Band plays a holiday concert and two spring concerts, including a performance at Carnegie Mellon’s Spring Carnival. Additionally, a part of the band gets together and acts as a pep band for the basketball teams.
The Kiltie Band is a campus organization recognized by Student Senate and administered by the Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation. Membership is open to all members of the campus/community without audition. Participants must do their best to promote the success of the ensemble through attendance, attitude, and dependability.

At the core of all modern Apple devices --- including iPhones, iPads and MacBooks --- is the Mach kernel, developed at CMU under the leadership of then-professor Rick Rashid. 11. Computer chess, 1990Could a computer play chess at the level of the world’s best players? For many years, it was considered the “holy grail” of artificial intelligence. Hitech, developed by CMU researcher Hans Berliner (CS’74), was the first computer to achieve grandmaster status. CMU alumni played key roles in developing “Deep Blue,” the IBM machine that beat human chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. 12. Java, 1991 As a CMU grad student, James Gosling (CS’83) worked on the Andrew project, which stressed interoperability between computers, whether they were Macs, IBMs or Unix machines. Those lessons served Gosling well when he developed Java, the first programming language able to run on almost any platform. 13. Email attachments, 1992Steve Jobs liked the email system built into CMU’s Andrew so much that he tried to hire Nathaniel Borenstein (CS’81,’85) and the rest of his team to create a similar program for Apple. Borenstein didn’t take the offer, but he did like Jobs’ idea about attaching documents to email. Borenstein went on to develop the MIME standard that’s used by all email programs to send photos and other files over the Internet. 14. Web search engines, 1994The World Wide Web was still in its toddler stage when CMU researcher Michael “Fuzzy” Mauldin (CS’83,’89) developed one of the first successful search engines, Lycos. It was the most-visited site on the Web by 1999. 15. Model checking, 1994CMU professor Edmund Clarke had long stressed the importance of verifying computer hardware and software through a formal problem-solving technique called “model checking.” In 1994, his arguments gained new weight with the discovery that Intel’s amazing new Pentium chip made errors on certain math problems. Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking. 16.

An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life. 21. RNA sequencing via videogames, 2010 Thanks to crowdsourcing, science isn’t just for scientists any more. People without formal training in molecular biology are producing new insights into genetic encoding through a videogame called EteRNA, developed by researchers at CMU and Stanford, that allows players to fold and shift RNA molecules to solve on-screen puzzles. 22. Language learning software, 2010Learning a second language has always been challenging, but a CMU spinoff called Duolingo is proving that it doesn’t have to be expensive. Duolingo has developed language tutoring software that enables users to learn Spanish, English, Italian, German, Portuguese or French for free through its website and mobile apps. In the process, Duolingo users are helping to translate the Web. 23. Question-answering computers, 2011 Searching the Web for information is rarely as simple as asking a question in plain English. So-called “question-answering” machines moved from laboratories to TV screens when an IBM computer called “Watson” defeated two human champions on the game show “Jeopardy!” At the heart of Watson was computer architecture developed by CMU’s Eric Nyberg and his students. 24. Encrypting online information, 2012 Credit card numbers and other data used online is safer thanks to an encryption scheme developed by CMU alumna Shafi Goldwasser (S’79). She shared the 2012 Turing Award for her role in developing practical encoding schemes that are difficult to break. 25. Smart, adaptable traffic signals, 2012 Smart traffic lights developed at CMU’s Robotics Institute are saving time and energy, and cutting down on the amount of air pollution created by idling cars. First rolled out in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood, the new signals are being studied around the country.

Question: How many Turing awards has CMU won?
Context: Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking. 16. CAPTCHAs, 2000 “Spam” and malicious attacks were a growing problem on the Internet when hackers developed automated “bots” that could sign up for email and other Web services without human intervention. Luis von Ahn (CS’03,’05), Nick Hopper (CS’04), John Langford (CS’02) and CMU professor Manuel Blum invented a “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart,” or CAPTCHA, to help foil the bots. A later variation, reCAPTCHA, is helping digitize old books and newspapers. 17. Robotic video cameras, 2001When Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent Dilfer dropped back to pass, TV viewers of Super Bowl XXXV saw something they’d never seen before --- the motion froze and the view suddenly rotated to show Dilfer’s opposite side. CBS called it Eyevision. The synchronized system of robotic cameras and advanced image processing was the brainchild of CMU’s Takeo Kanade, one of many advances he pioneered in computer vision. 18. Self-driving vehicles, 2007Carnegie Mellon’s early attempts at self-driving vehicles progressed slowly, creeping around Pittsburgh’s Schenley Park in the late 1990s. But they were going full-throttle by the time CMU’s self-driving SUV, named BOSS, won the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge road race. 19. Thought reading programs, 2007Your brain reacts in different ways, depending on what words you’re thinking about --- ways that are measurable with magnetic-resonance imaging, or MRI, machines. CMU researchers Tom Mitchell and Marcel Just are decoding those brain scans and are making progress at reading people’s thoughts. 20. Kidney donor matching, 2008 Organ transplants save lives every day, but more people could likely be saved if it was easier to match recipients with donors who are unrelated. An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life. 21. RNA sequencing via videogames, 2010 Thanks to crowdsourcing, science isn’t just for scientists any more.

Faculty Bio : Ralf Brown
Senior Systems Scientist/Chair of Admissions, Language Technologies Institute
Research Area : Information Extraction, Summarization and Question Answering, Information Retrieval, Text Mining and Analytics, Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics

Research:
My research interests primarily revolve around multilingual processing, with sidelines in text categorization and information extraction:
Machine Translation
I have worked primarily on example-based machine translation (EBMT), a data-driven translation approach that originated a few years before statistical machine translation characterized by the use of individual examples from the training corpus during translation. I have also applied my EBMT system to cross-language information retrieval and speech-to-speech translation.

Digital Forensics
I have worked on reconstructing corrupted ZIP archives and on extracting text in arbitrary encodings from files and raw disk images. As part of this work, I developed language identification for more than 1,300 languages, and am continuing to improve the accuracy with which languages can be identified.

Information Extraction
My current work focuses on extracting actions and affected components from aircraft maintenance records.

Title: Fairness Through Domain Awareness: Mitigating Popularity Bias For Music Discovery
Year: 2023
Abstract: As online music platforms grow, music recommender systems play a vital role in helping users navigate and discover content within their vast musical databases. At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias, which causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially more relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic relationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this issue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which addresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender systems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth listening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should be reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful music discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music domain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing recommendations at both the playlist level and user level. Then, we ground our evaluation in the cold start setting, showing that our approach outperforms existing fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of lesser-known content. Finally, our analysis explains why our proposed methodology is a novel and promising approach to mitigating popularity bias and improving the discovery of new and niche content in music recommender systems.

Title: Clusterin protects mature dendritic cells from reactive oxygen species mediated cell death
Year: 2023
Abstract: ABSTRACT Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the induction of the adaptive immune response. They capture antigens in peripheral tissues and prime naïve T lymphocytes, triggering the adaptive immune response. In the course of inflammatory processes DCs face stressful conditions including hypoxia, low pH and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), among others. How DCs survive under these adverse conditions remain poorly understood. Clusterin is a protein highly expressed by tumors and usually associated with bad prognosis. It promotes cancer cell survival by different mechanisms such as apoptosis inhibition and promotion of autophagy. Here, we show that, upon maturation, human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) up-regulate clusterin expression. Clusterin protects MoDCs from ROS-mediated toxicity, enhancing DC survival and promoting their ability to induce T cell activation. In line with these results, we found that clusterin is expressed by a population of mature LAMP3+ DCs, called mregDCs, but not by immature DCs in human cancer. The expression of clusterin by intratumoral DCs was shown to be associated with a transcriptomic profile indicative of cellular response to stress. These results uncover an important role for clusterin in DC physiology.

Research
I am interested in artificial intelligence and its application to real-world problems. Over the years, I have worked in many areas of AI, including knowledge representation, planning, image processing, machine learning, massively parallel approaches to search and inference, and the development of improved learning algorithms for artificial neural networks.
My current project is Scone, an open-source knowledge representation system and inference engine that can be used as a component in a variety of knowledge-based systems. Scone puts particular emphasis on efficiency, scalability (up to millions of entities and statements) and ease of use. One goal of our research is to support natural-language understanding, all the way from text or speech to a language-independent representation that we can reason about. This requires extensive use of background knowledge not included in the text itself. We are also working to extend Scone's capabilities for ""episodic"" representation and reasoning, by which we mean actions, events, sequences of actions, plans, goals and explanations.
I have also worked on programming languages and software-development environments that support an incremental, evolutionary software-development style. This work has been done in Common Lisp, Dylan and Java.

Research
My research has centered on statistical learning methods/algorithms and application to very-large-scale text categorization, web-mining for concept graph discovery, semi-supervised clustering, multitask learning, novelty-based information retrieval, large-scale optimization for online advertising, social network analysis for personalized email prioritization, etc. My recent research focuses on the following topics:

Large-Scale Structured Learning for Hierarchical Classification  (Gopal & Yang, KDD 2013;  Gopal & Yang, ICML 2013 & Supplementary  ;  Gopal et al., NIPS 2012)

Providing organizational views of multi-source Big Data (e.g., Wikipedia, online shops, Coursera)
State-of-the-art classifiers for large-scale classification over hundreds of thousands of categories
Scalable variational inference for joint optimization of one trillion (4 TB) model parameters
Scalable Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis (Topic Detection and Tracking)

From scientific literature, news stories, sensor signals, maintenance reports, etc.
Modeling multi-source and multi-scale evidence of dynamic chances in temporal sequences. (On-going NSF project; Gopal, PhD Thesis)
A new family of Bayesian von Mices Fischer (vMF) clustering techniques (Gopal & Yang, ICML 2014 & Supplementary)
Unsupervised clustering and semi-supervised metric learning and supervised classification (Gopal & Yang, UAI 2014 & Supplimentary).
Concept Graph Learning for Online Education (NSF project; Yang et al., WSDM 2015)

Mapping online course materials to Wikipedia categories as the Interlingua (universal concepts)
Predicting conceptual dependencies among courses based on partially observed prerequisites
Planning customized curriculum for individuals based on backgrounds and goals
Macro-Level Information Fusion for Events and Entities (joint effort with Jaime Carbonell in the DARPA DEFT project)

Detecting entities and events of interest in various forms of mentions in text to enable high-precision, semi-structured information fusion and summarization. Using a corporate acquisition event as an example, different (and partially redundant) sentences can mention acquirer, price, date, approvals, joint-management, etc. This multi-aspect information needs to be jointly extracted into a unified structured form for this event type, with uncertainty estimates in the aggregated representation.

Title: Fusion-in-T5: Unifying Document Ranking Signals for Improved Information Retrieval
Year: 2023
Abstract: Common IR pipelines are typically cascade systems that may involve multiple rankers and/or fusion models to integrate different information step-by-step. In this paper, we propose a novel re-ranker named Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), which integrates document text information, retrieval features, and global document information into a single unified model using templated-based input and global attention. Experiments on passage ranking benchmarks MS MARCO and TREC DL show that FiT5 significantly improves ranking performance over prior pipelines. Analyses find that through global attention, FiT5 is able to jointly utilize the ranking features via gradually attending to related documents, and thus improve the detection of subtle nuances between them. Our code will be open-sourced.

Title: Latest results on searching for fractionally charged particles with the DAMPE experiment
Year: 2023
Abstract: The existence of fractionally charged particles (FCP) is foreseen in extensions of or beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Most of the previously conducted searches for FCPs in cosmic rays were based on experiments underground or at high altitudes. However, there have been few searches for FCPs in cosmic rays carried out in orbit other than AMS-01 flown by a space shuttle and BESS by a balloon at the top of the atmosphere. In this study, we conduct an FCP search in space based on on-orbit data obtained using the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite over a period of five years. Unlike underground experiments, which require an FCP energy of the order of hundreds of GeV, our FCP search starts at only a few GeV. An upper limit of 6 . 2 × 10 − 10 cm − 2 sr − 1 s − 1 is obtained for the flux. Our results demonstrate that DAMPE exhibits higher sensitivity than experiments of similar types by three orders of magnitude that more stringently restricts the conditions for the existence of FCP in primary cosmic rays.

Title: DPHuBERT: Joint Distillation and Pruning of Self-Supervised Speech Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved notable success in many speech processing tasks, but the large model size and heavy computational cost hinder the deployment. Knowledge distillation trains a small student model to mimic the behavior of a large teacher model. However, the student architecture usually needs to be manually designed and will remain fixed during training, which requires prior knowledge and can lead to suboptimal performance. Inspired by recent success of task-specific structured pruning, we propose DPHuBERT, a novel task-agnostic compression method for speech SSL based on joint distillation and pruning. Experiments on SUPERB show that DPHuBERT outperforms pure distillation methods in almost all tasks. Moreover, DPHuBERT requires little training time and performs well with limited training data, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications. Our method can also be applied to various speech SSL models. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Title: Toward Universal Speech Enhancement For Diverse Input Conditions
Year: 2023
Abstract: The past decade has witnessed substantial growth of data-driven speech enhancement (SE) techniques thanks to deep learning. While existing approaches have shown impressive performance in some common datasets, most of them are designed only for a single condition (e.g., single-channel, multi-channel, or a fixed sampling frequency) or only consider a single task (e.g., denoising or dereverberation). Currently, there is no universal SE approach that can effectively handle diverse input conditions with a single model. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate this line of research. First, we devise a single SE model that is independent of microphone channels, signal lengths, and sampling frequencies. Second, we design a universal SE benchmark by combining existing public corpora with multiple conditions. Our experiments on a wide range of datasets show that the proposed single model can successfully handle diverse conditions with strong performance.

systems. General Observations As in previous years, the low-resource shared task proved particularly challenging for the participants, but there are several encouraging signs that further reinforce the need for more research in the area. First, more teams than ever participated in the shared task, showing a continued interest in the field. Second, we note that for the language pair that was repeated from last year (Tamasheq– French), almost all submissions outperformed last year’s best submission, with an accuracy increase of more than 17 BLEU points in the unconstrained setting.

Title: Queer People are People First: Deconstructing Sexual Identity Stereotypes in Large Language Models
Year: 2023
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained primarily on minimally processed web text, which exhibits the same wide range of social biases held by the humans who created that content. Consequently, text generated by LLMs can inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes towards marginalized groups, like the LGBTQIA+ community. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of how LLMs generate text describing people with different sexual identities. Analyzing bias in the text generated by an LLM using regard score shows measurable bias against queer people. We then show that a post-hoc method based on chain-of-thought prompting using SHAP analysis can increase the regard of the sentence, representing a promising approach towards debiasing the output of LLMs in this setting.

Title: GPT-Sentinel: Distinguishing Human and ChatGPT Generated Content
Year: 2023
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for detecting ChatGPT-generated vs. human-written text using language models. To this end, we first collected and released a pre-processed dataset named OpenGPTText, which consists of rephrased content generated using ChatGPT. We then designed, implemented, and trained two different models for text classification, using Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) and Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5), respectively. Our models achieved remarkable results, with an accuracy of over 97% on the test dataset, as evaluated through various metrics. Furthermore, we conducted an interpretability study to showcase our model's ability to extract and differentiate key features between human-written and ChatGPT-generated text. Our findings provide important insights into the effective use of language models to detect generated text.

It is a long-standing and revered principle of the School of Computer Science (SCS) that 
members of our community are expected to act reasonably, and therefore we try to keep formal, 
written SCS policies to a minimum.  The faculty do not burden the students with numerous 
rules, and, in return, we expect the students to not try to find technical loopholes that violate 
the clear intent of program policies.  In any situation not covered by an explicit rule, you should 
ask yourself how reasonable people would behave in that situation.  The RPP does not alter 
University-wide policies.

Title: Riveter: Measuring Power and Social Dynamics Between Entities
Year: 2023
Abstract: Riveter provides a complete easy-to-use pipeline for analyzing verb connotations associated with entities in text corpora. We prepopulate the package with connotation frames of sentiment, power, and agency, which have demonstrated usefulness for capturing social phenomena, such as gender bias, in a broad range of corpora. For decades, lexical frameworks have been foundational tools in computational social science, digital humanities, and natural language processing, facilitating multifaceted analysis of text corpora. But working with verb-centric lexica specifically requires natural language processing skills, reducing their accessibility to other researchers. By organizing the language processing pipeline, providing complete lexicon scores and visualizations for all entities in a corpus, and providing functionality for users to target specific research questions, Riveter greatly improves the accessibility of verb lexica and can facilitate a broad range of future research.

Title: Improving Language Models with Advantage-based Offline Policy Gradients
Year: 2023
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) achieve substantial language capabilities when finetuned using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality LM-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LoL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action, A-LoL allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM's internal sequence-level value estimate, A-LoL filters negative advantage (low-quality) data points during training, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LoL is an easy-to-implement LM training recipe that is sample-efficient and stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LoL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO) and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless Assistant (HHA), LMs trained with A-LoL methods achieve the highest diversity while also being rated more safe and helpful than baselines according to humans. Additionally, in the remaining three tasks, A-LoL could optimize multiple distinct reward functions even when using noisy or suboptimal training data. We also release our experimental code. https://github.com/abaheti95/LoL-RL

Title: Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics

for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4
Year: 2023
Abstract: The advent and fast development of neural networks have revolutionized the research on dialogue systems and subsequently have triggered various challenges regarding their automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation of open-domain dialogue systems as an open challenge has been the center of the attention of many researchers. Despite the consistent efforts to improve automatic metrics’ correlations with human evaluation, there have been very few attempts to assess their robustness over multiple domains and dimensions. Also, their focus is mainly on the English language. All of these challenges prompt the development of automatic evaluation metrics that are reliable in various domains, dimensions, and languages. This track in the 11th Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC11) is part of the ongoing effort to promote robust and multilingual automatic evaluation metrics. This article describes the datasets and baselines provided to participants and discusses the submission and result details of the two proposed subtasks.

Multimodal Computing and Interaction, Speech Processing, Spoken Interfaces and Dialogue Processing

Research
My research centers on interactive systems that use speech. I am currently interested in the following problems:

Implicit Learning : Human-computer interaction generates information that the system could use to modify its behavior. For example, a speech recognition error that is repaired leaves information about a misclassification that could be used to improve subsequent accuracy. Exploiting such situations (and in fact contriving to create them) can provide a rich set of experiences that drive self-improving systems

Automatic detection and recovery from error: Humans easily detect and recover from breakdowns in communication. Automatic systems are less successful at this, however we can use features of recognition, understanding and dialog to predict the likelihood of misunderstanding at a given point in an interaction, and then apply heuristic strategies for guiding the conversation back onto track.

A theory of language design for speech-based interactive systems: Speech-mode communication predisposes the user to make certain word choices and to exhibit certain grammatical preferences. An understanding of the principles that underlie these preferences (and how these can be influenced by the system's language) leads to better language design for interactive systems.

The role of speech in the computer interface: Speech is an effective means of communication, but it is not always suitable for all types of interaction. Ideally we can analyze an interface in terms of the task(s) it will be used for, the costs of specific interactions and the value perceived by the user. To date we've studied models based on time, system error and task structure. These models turn out to be useful for simple systems and appear to be extensible to more complex systems. Many of these issues are being explored in the context of working systems, for example a language interface for a team of humans and robots working together (Treasure Hunt) or a information access for conferences (ConQuest) or for scheduling court time (Let’s Play).

Title: Learning to Ask Questions for Zero-shot Dialogue State Tracking
Year: 2023
Abstract: We present a method for performing zero-shot Dialogue State Tracking (DST) by casting the task as a learning-to-ask-questions framework. The framework learns to pair the best question generation (QG) strategy with in-domain question answering (QA) methods to extract slot values from a dialogue without any human intervention. A novel self-supervised QA pretraining step using in-domain data is essential to learn the structure without requiring any slot-filling annotations. Moreover, we show that QG methods need to be aligned with the same grammatical person used in the dialogue. Empirical evaluation on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset demonstrates that our approach, when used alongside robust QA models, outperforms existing zero-shot methods in the challenging task of zero-shot cross domain adaptation-given a comparable amount of domain knowledge during data creation. Finally, we analyze the impact of the types of questions used, and demonstrate that the algorithmic approach outperforms template-based question generation.

My research focuses on better understanding the social and pragmatic nature of conversation, and using this understanding to build computational systems that improve the efficacy of conversation both between people, and between people and computers. In order to pursue these goals, I invoke approaches from computational discourse analysis and text mining, conversational agents, and computer-supported collaborative learning. I ground my research in the fields of language technologies and human-computer interaction, and am fortunate to work closely with students and post-docs from the LTI and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, as well as to direct my own lab, TELEDIA. My group’s highly interdisciplinary work, published in 160 peer-reviewed publications, is represented in the top venues in five fields: language technologies, learning sciences, cognitive science, educational technology and human-computer interaction.

An exciting direction of my group's work is spearheading a satellite working group to support social interaction for learning in MOOCs with EdX called DANCE. My research toward this end has birthed and substantially contributed to the growth of two thriving interrelated research areas: automated analysis of collaborative learning processes and dynamic support for collaborative learning. Both areas use intelligent conversational agents to support collaborative learning in a context-sensitive way.

All of my work draws insight from rich theoretical models from sociolinguistics and discourse analysis, and pares them down to precise operationalizations that capture the most important essence for achieving impact. I always start by investigating how conversation works and formalizing this understanding in models that are precise enough to be reproducible and that demonstrate explanatory power in connection with outcomes with real-world value. The next step is to adapt, extend and apply machine learning and text mining technologies that leverage this deep understanding to build computational models capable of automatically applying these constructs to naturally occurring language interactions. Finally, with the technology to automatically monitor naturalistic language communication in place, we can build interventions with real-world benefits.

Section: Conclusion
The four articles of this September issue of the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning are interesting as a set in that they highlight a multiplicity of different research methodologies employed by CSCL researchers. These methodologies span from quantitative to qualitative to mixed-methods approaches, in most cases with new data, but sometimes including secondary data analysis, as in the final paper of this issue. Types of data include the gamut from video, to drawings, to tests and questionnaires. Within this diversity of methodological practices, common themes related to student learning through the cognitive scaffolding they offer each other run throughout this issue.

Section: Introduction
collected from 3 large classrooms where a peer review activity with the Peerceptiv system (Wu & Schunn, 2022) was conducted. Results from the study could inform development of an automated algorithm to group students for interaction based on a policy considering skill level of the students, in this case to offer one another feedback on writing. As in the Tan et al. study, feedback was offered through a structured peer feedback interface, which is a form of explicit scaffolding for processes. However, in contrast, interventions that group students in order to promote productive learning processes can be regarded as implicit scaffolding for collaboration (Wang et al., 2017). The research aimed to identify the optimal level of detail regarding assessment of skill for the purpose of assigning students to effective pairings. Past work on pairing based on 1 3 325 C. P. Rosé, S. Järvelä skill level with a coarse grained approach failed to demonstrate an impact of this intentional pairing. In this study, both a coarse grained and a fine grained approach were evaluated and then contrasted. The analysis of results demonstrated that fine grained matching is needed in order to yield a significant effect. An interesting feature of the analysis of results is that the impact of the intervention was evaluated both at the whole class level as well as at the subset level (e.g., within ability level groupings). Since fine-grained matching by ability level was demonstrated to be optimal except in pairs where both are at the very low ability level, it is necessary to consider the relationship between effects of differently nuanced policies from the receiver level and the giver level, as measured within ability level groupings and over the class as a whole in order to make an informed decision for a specific class, with its own unique distribution of skill levels across students.

Section: Introduction
characteristics of students and supportive interventions on student participation in chat activities and subsequently their retention in the course. MOOC students were assigned to one of three conditions, namely: control, general intervention, and personalized intervention. The experimental manipulation happened outside of the collaborative-chat activities and determined the kind of support, if any, offered through email messages that occurred at regular intervals throughout the course. Students were all offered the opportunity to participate in chat-based collaborative activities regardless of condition. While prior work investigating the impact of chat activities on retention in MOOCs demonstrated that participation in the collaborative activities promoted retention, the majority of students in that past study did not choose to participate in the chat activities (Tomar et al., 2016). Thus, this current study that demonstrates the impact of an intervention outside of the chat activities that promotes student participation in the chat activities themselves is an important landmark. The second article, by Yuyao Tong and Carol K. K. Chan, is entitled “Promoting Knowledge Building through Meta-Discourse and Epistemic Discourse Understanding”. This article presented a quasi-experimental design contrasting two classrooms, both using Knowledge Forum, but under different conditions. This study is one in a long history of Knowledge Forum studies featured in this journal (e.g., Zhang et al., 2020; van Aalst, 2009). While a great many past studies of Knowledge Forum presented analyses that focused on classroom communities where everyone experienced the same intervention, this study offers the opportunity for statistical contrast between students in a class where the intervention is present within the Knowledge Forum and a class where it was not present. The experimental contrast focused on enrichment of meta-discourse in the midst of knowledge building. An interesting aspect of the meta-discourse that students participated in was that they expressed their ideas about the discourse graphically through drawings. A wide variety of data were collected throughout the study, including video, tests, and the discourse itself from Knowledge Forum.

Title: Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA
Year: 2023
Abstract: The DialDoc 2023 shared task has expanded the document-grounded dialogue task to encompass multiple languages, despite having limited annotated data. This paper assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained transformer models in a bi-encoder-based dense passage retriever (DPR), concluding that the language-agnostic approach is superior. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of query rewriting techniques using large language models, such as ChatGPT, on multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems. The experiments conducted demonstrate that, for the examples examined, query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries. This failure is due to topic switching in final dialogue turns and irrelevant topics being considered for query rewriting.

My research is concerned with language and its role in human communication. In particular, my long-term research goal is to break down barriers in human-human or human-machine communication through the development of natural language processing (NLP) technologies. This includes the development of technology for machine translation, which helps break down barriers in communication for people who speak different languages, and natural language understanding, which helps computers understand and respond to human language. Within this overall goal of breaking down barriers to human communication, I have focused on several aspects of language that both make it interesting as a scientific subject, and hold potential for the construction of practical systems.

Advances in core NLP technology: Human language is complex and nuanced, and handling this complexity in a computational way requires sophisticated algorithms or learning techniques, the development of which is far from a solved problem. The first major area of my work focuses on advances in core NLP technology, which improve the accuracy with which we can analyze, translate, generate, or reply to textual inputs. 

Models of language associated with other modalities: Human language does not exist in a vacuum, and is often associated with context from the world around it. The second thread of my research focuses on models of natural language associated with other modalities, tackling the problems, and exploiting the fascinating possibilities presented by having text associated with other types of information. Specifically, I have worked extensively with speech, and am also interested in associations between natural and formal languages such as source code.

Learning from naturally occurring data: Language data exists in abundance, particularly due to the advent of the internet, and it is possible to acquire extremely large amounts of this data for scientific or engineering purposes. A third thread of my research focuses on learning NLP models from naturally occurring data through the use of unsupervised, semi-supervised, or active learning, which allows us to exploit this data to improve models while reducing the necessity for costly manual annotation.

Title: DataFinder: Scientific Dataset Recommendation from Natural Language Descriptions
Year: 2023
Abstract: Modern machine learning relies on datasets to develop and validate research ideas. Given the growth of publicly available data, finding the right dataset to use is increasingly difficult. Any research question imposes explicit and implicit constraints on how well a given dataset will enable researchers to answer this question, such as dataset size, modality, and domain. We operationalize the task of recommending datasets given a short natural language description of a research idea, to help people find relevant datasets for their needs. Dataset recommendation poses unique challenges as an information retrieval problem; datasets are hard to directly index for search and there are no corpora readily available for this task. To facilitate this task, we build the DataFinder Dataset which consists of a larger automatically-constructed training set (17.5K queries) and a smaller expert-annotated evaluation set (392 queries). Using this data, we compare various information retrieval algorithms on our test set and present a superior bi-encoder retriever for text-based dataset recommendation. This system, trained on the DataFinder Dataset, finds more relevant search results than existing third-party dataset search engines. To encourage progress on dataset recommendation, we release our dataset and models to the public.

Title: Solving NLP Problems through Human-System Collaboration: A Discussion-based Approach
Year: 2023
Abstract: Humans work together to solve common problems by having discussions, explaining, and agreeing or disagreeing with each other. Similarly, if a system can have discussions with humans when solving tasks, it can improve the system's performance and reliability. In previous research on explainability, it has only been possible for the system to make predictions and for humans to ask questions about them rather than having a mutual exchange of opinions. This research aims to create a dataset and computational framework for systems that discuss and refine their predictions through dialogue. Through experiments, we show that the proposed system can have beneficial discussions with humans improving the accuracy by up to 25 points in the natural language inference task.

Title: GlobalBench: A Benchmark for Global Progress in Natural Language Processing
Year: 2023
Abstract: Despite the major advances in NLP, significant disparities in NLP system performance across languages still exist. Arguably, these are due to uneven resource allocation and sub-optimal incentives to work on less resourced languages. To track and further incentivize the global development of equitable language technology, we introduce GlobalBench. Prior multilingual benchmarks are static and have focused on a limited number of tasks and languages. In contrast, GlobalBench is an ever-expanding collection that aims to dynamically track progress on all NLP datasets in all languages. Rather than solely measuring accuracy, GlobalBench also tracks the estimated per-speaker utility and equity of technology across all languages, providing a multi-faceted view of how language technology is serving people of the world. Furthermore, GlobalBench is designed to identify the most under-served languages, and rewards research efforts directed towards those languages. At present, the most under-served languages are the ones with a relatively high population, but nonetheless overlooked by composite multilingual benchmarks (like Punjabi, Portuguese, and Wu Chinese). Currently, GlobalBench covers 966 datasets in 190 languages, and has 1,128 system submissions spanning 62 languages.

Title: PWESuite: Phonetic Word Embeddings and Tasks They Facilitate
Year: 2023
Abstract: Mapping words into a fixed-dimensional vector space is the backbone of modern NLP. While most word embedding methods successfully encode semantic information, they overlook phonetic information that is crucial for many tasks. We develop three methods that use articulatory features to build phonetically informed word embeddings. To address the inconsistent evaluation of existing phonetic word embedding methods, we also contribute a task suite to fairly evaluate past, current, and future methods. We evaluate both (1) intrinsic aspects of phonetic word embeddings, such as word retrieval and correlation with sound similarity, and (2) extrinsic performance on tasks such as rhyme and cognate detection and sound analogies. We hope our task suite will promote reproducibility and inspire future phonetic embedding research.

Title: Expanding the Role of Affective Phenomena in Multimodal Interaction Research
Year: 2023
Abstract: In recent decades, the field of affective computing has made substantial progress in advancing the ability of AI systems to recognize and express affective phenomena, such as affect and emotions, during human-human and human-machine interactions. This paper describes our examination of research at the intersection of multimodal interaction and affective computing, with the objective of observing trends and identifying understudied areas. We examined over 16,000 papers from selected conferences in multimodal interaction, affective computing, and natural language processing: ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, AAAC International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction, Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. We identified 910 affect-related papers and present our analysis of the role of affective phenomena in these papers. We find that this body of research has primarily focused on enabling machines to recognize or express affect and emotion; there has been limited research on how affect and emotion predictions might, in turn, be used by AI systems to enhance machine understanding of human social behaviors and cognitive states. Based on our analysis, we discuss directions to expand the role of affective phenomena in multimodal interaction research.

Research
My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, computational linguistics and signal processing — building the computational foundations to enable computers with the abilities to analyze, recognize and predict subtle human communicative behaviors during social interactions. Human face-to-face communication is a little like a dance: participants continuously adjust their behaviors based on their interlocutor’s speech, gestures and facial expressions during social interaction. The actual sophistication of human communication comes to the fore when we try to create computers that can understand and participate, however crudely, in this type of social interaction.

Human Communication Dynamics
I formalize this new research endeavor with a human communication dynamics framework, addressing four key computational challenges: behavioral dynamics to model the appearance and temporal variations of individual communicative behaviors and their effects on perceived meanings; multimodal dynamics to model the interdependence between different communicative channels including visual gestures and expressions, language, and acoustic signals; interpersonal dynamics to model the social and conversational influence between participants during dyadic or small-group interactions (i.e., micro-level); and societal dynamics to model the cultural and behavioral changes in a larger groups (i.e., meso-level) or in different societies (i.e, macro-level).

Multimodal Machine Learning
Central to this research effort is the introduction of new probabilistic models that can learn temporal and fine-grained dependencies across behaviors, modalities and interlocutors. These energy-based probabilistic models must address core computational issues with human communication dynamics, including hierarchical and nonlinear feature representation, multiview learning and potential over fitting on smaller training sets. For example, I created a family of latent probabilistic models (HCRF, LDCRF, CCNF, etc.) designed to automatically learn the hidden dynamics present in human verbal and nonverbal communication.

Health Behavior Informatics
This research has many applications in education (learning analytics), business (negotiation, interpersonal skills training) and social multimedia (opinion mining, social influence). One area I am particularly excited about is the development of new decision support tools for healthcare applications. For example, how can we quantify, analyze and summarize patient verbal and nonverbal behaviors during psychotherapy?

Title: Counterfactual Augmentation for Multimodal Learning Under Presentation Bias
Year: 2023
Abstract: In real-world machine learning systems, labels are often derived from user behaviors that the system wishes to encourage. Over time, new models must be trained as new training examples and features become available. However, feedback loops between users and models can bias future user behavior, inducing a presentation bias in the labels that compromises the ability to train new models. In this paper, we propose counterfactual augmentation, a novel causal method for correcting presentation bias using generated counterfactual labels. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that counterfactual augmentation yields better downstream performance compared to both uncorrected models and existing bias-correction methods. Model analyses further indicate that the generated counterfactuals align closely with true counterfactuals in an oracle setting.

Title: Language Models Get a Gender Makeover: Mitigating Gender Bias with Few-Shot Data Interventions
Year: 2023
Abstract: Societal biases present in pre-trained large language models are a critical issue as these models have been shown to propagate biases in countless downstream applications, rendering them unfair towards specific groups of people. Since large-scale retraining of these models from scratch is both time and compute-expensive, a variety of approaches have been previously proposed that de-bias a pre-trained model. While the majority of current state-of-the-art debiasing methods focus on changes to the training regime, in this paper, we propose data intervention strategies as a powerful yet simple technique to reduce gender bias in pre-trained models. Specifically, we empirically show that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 debiased (intervened) training examples, the tendency to favor any gender is significantly reduced. Since our proposed method only needs a few training examples, we argue that our few-shot de-biasing approach is highly feasible and practical. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our de-biasing technique performs better than competitive state-of-the-art baselines with minimal loss in language modeling ability.

Title: Expanding the Role of Afective Phenomena in Multimodal Interaction Research
Authors: Leena Mathur, Maja J Matarić, Louis-Philippe Morency
Section: 6 SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
cognitively and neurally-inspired models have the potential to advance the ability of AI systems to use afective phenomena in order to better understand human social behaviors and cognitive states. (3) Expanding Multimodal Social Interaction Contexts: We fnd that a majority of the papers in our sample focus on monadic contexts, with a limited focus on challenges present in dyadic and multi-party contexts. We recommend that future research eforts explore how AI systems can better integrate afective state predictions from multiple people and multiple contexts to inform models of social behaviors and cognitive states in group-level dynamics. For example, how can an AI system integrate its afect predictions of both people in a dyad in order to predict their synchrony (grouplevel behavior) [75]? How can afective state predictions of one person in a multi-party interaction inform an AI system’s understanding of behavior and cognition in other participants? (4) Expanding Application Areas: We fnd that several of the papers successfully used afective phenomena to model social behaviors and cognitive states in the domains of healthcare (e.g., modeling depression, doctor-patient communication dynamics) [26, 61–63, 65, 66, 72, 78] and education (e.g., modeling student learning dynamics) [2, 17, 69]. We recommend that future research eforts further explore how afective phenomena can be used as features, auxiliary tasks, and latent states to improve AI systems that support human health, education, and well-being through applications and empirical validation in additional populations and social contexts. Since it is possible that afective phenomena might not be useful to inform models in all settings, we recommend that future research explore techniques to enable AI systems to efciently estimate when they need to query afective state information from their environment in order to improve their understanding of the social behaviors and cognitive states of the people around them.

Research
My research centers on interactive systems that use speech. I am currently interested in the following problems:

Implicit Learning : Human-computer interaction generates information that the system could use to modify its behavior. For example, a speech recognition error that is repaired leaves information about a misclassification that could be used to improve subsequent accuracy. Exploiting such situations (and in fact contriving to create them) can provide a rich set of experiences that drive self-improving systems

Automatic detection and recovery from error: Humans easily detect and recover from breakdowns in communication. Automatic systems are less successful at this, however we can use features of recognition, understanding and dialog to predict the likelihood of misunderstanding at a given point in an interaction, and then apply heuristic strategies for guiding the conversation back onto track.

A theory of language design for speech-based interactive systems: Speech-mode communication predisposes the user to make certain word choices and to exhibit certain grammatical preferences. An understanding of the principles that underlie these preferences (and how these can be influenced by the system's language) leads to better language design for interactive systems.

The role of speech in the computer interface: Speech is an effective means of communication, but it is not always suitable for all types of interaction. Ideally we can analyze an interface in terms of the task(s) it will be used for, the costs of specific interactions and the value perceived by the user. To date we've studied models based on time, system error and task structure. These models turn out to be useful for simple systems and appear to be extensible to more complex systems. Many of these issues are being explored in the context of working systems, for example a language interface for a team of humans and robots working together (Treasure Hunt) or a information access for conferences (ConQuest) or for scheduling court time (Let’s Play).

Research
I am interested in artificial intelligence and its application to real-world problems. Over the years, I have worked in many areas of AI, including knowledge representation, planning, image processing, machine learning, massively parallel approaches to search and inference, and the development of improved learning algorithms for artificial neural networks.
My current project is Scone, an open-source knowledge representation system and inference engine that can be used as a component in a variety of knowledge-based systems. Scone puts particular emphasis on efficiency, scalability (up to millions of entities and statements) and ease of use. One goal of our research is to support natural-language understanding, all the way from text or speech to a language-independent representation that we can reason about. This requires extensive use of background knowledge not included in the text itself. We are also working to extend Scone's capabilities for ""episodic"" representation and reasoning, by which we mean actions, events, sequences of actions, plans, goals and explanations.
I have also worked on programming languages and software-development environments that support an incremental, evolutionary software-development style. This work has been done in Common Lisp, Dylan and Java.

Title: SPAE: Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs
Year: 2023
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder (SPAE) for enabling frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-linguistic modalities such as images or videos. SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks. Our method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%.

Title: HomeRobot: Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation
Year: 2023
Abstract: HomeRobot (noun): An affordable compliant robot that navigates homes and manipulates a wide range of objects in order to complete everyday tasks. Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) is the problem of picking any object in any unseen environment, and placing it in a commanded location. This is a foundational challenge for robots to be useful assistants in human environments, because it involves tackling sub-problems from across robotics: perception, language understanding, navigation, and manipulation are all essential to OVMM. In addition, integration of the solutions to these sub-problems poses its own substantial challenges. To drive research in this area, we introduce the HomeRobot OVMM benchmark, where an agent navigates household environments to grasp novel objects and place them on target receptacles. HomeRobot has two components: a simulation component, which uses a large and diverse curated object set in new, high-quality multi-room home environments; and a real-world component, providing a software stack for the low-cost Hello Robot Stretch to encourage replication of real-world experiments across labs. We implement both reinforcement learning and heuristic (model-based) baselines and show evidence of sim-to-real transfer. Our baselines achieve a 20% success rate in the real world; our experiments identify ways future research work improve performance. See videos on our website: https://ovmm.github.io/.

Title: MOSAIC: Learning Unified Multi-Sensory Object Property Representations for Robot Perception
Year: 2023
Abstract: A holistic understanding of object properties across diverse sensory modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and haptic) is essential for tasks ranging from object categorization to complex manipulation. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science studies that emphasize the significance of multi-sensory integration in human perception, we introduce MOSAIC (Multimodal Object property learning with Self-Attention and Interactive Comprehension), a novel framework designed to facilitate the learning of unified multi-sensory object property representations. While it is undeniable that visual information plays a prominent role, we acknowledge that many fundamental object properties extend beyond the visual domain to encompass attributes like texture, mass distribution, or sounds, which significantly influence how we interact with objects. In MOSAIC, we leverage this profound insight by distilling knowledge from multimodal foundation models and aligning these representations not only across vision but also haptic and auditory sensory modalities. Through extensive experiments on a dataset where a humanoid robot interacts with 100 objects across 10 exploratory behaviors, we demonstrate the versatility of MOSAIC in two task families: object categorization and object-fetching tasks. Our results underscore the efficacy of MOSAIC's unified representations, showing competitive performance in category recognition through a simple linear probe setup and excelling in the fetch object task under zero-shot transfer conditions. This work pioneers the application of sensory grounding in foundation models for robotics, promising a significant leap in multi-sensory perception capabilities for autonomous systems. We have released the code, datasets, and additional results: https://github.com/gtatiya/MOSAIC.

Title: KALE: Using a K-Sparse Projector for Lexical Expansion
Year: 2023
Abstract: Recent research has proposed retrieval approaches based on sparse representations and inverted indexes, with terms produced by neural language models and leveraging the advantages from both neural retrieval and lexical matching. This paper proposes KALE, a new lightweight method of this family that uses a small model with a k-sparse projector to convert dense representations into a sparse set of entries from a latent vocabulary. The KALE vocabulary captures semantic concepts than perform well when used in isolation, and perform better when extending the original lexical vocabulary, this way improving first-stage retrieval accuracy. Experiments with the MSMARCOv1 passage retrieval dataset, the TREC Deep Learning dataset, and BEIR datasets, examined the effectiveness of KALE under varying conditions. Results show that the KALE terms can replace the original lexical vocabulary, with gains in accuracy and efficiency. Combining KALE with the original lexical vocabulary, or with other learned terms, can further improve retrieval accuracy with only a modest increase in computational cost.

Title: CSurF: Sparse Lexical Retrieval through Contextualized Surface Forms
Year: 2023
Abstract: Lexical exact-match systems perform text retrieval efficiently with sparse matching signals and fast retrieval through inverted lists, but naturally suffer from the mismatch between lexical surface form and implicit term semantics. This paper proposes to directly bridge the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSF). Each CSF pairs a lexical surface form with a context source, and is represented by a lexical form weight and a contextualized semantic vector representation. This framework is able to perform sparse lexicon-based retrieval by learning to represent each query and document as a ""bag-of-CSFs"", simultaneously addressing two key factors in sparse retrieval: vocabulary expansion of surface form and semantic representation of term meaning. At retrieval time, it efficiently matches CSFs through exact-match of learned surface forms, and effectively scores each CSF pair via contextual semantic representations, leading to joint improvement in both term match and term scoring. Multiple experiments show that this approach successfully resolves the main mismatch issues in lexical exact-match retrieval and outperforms state-of-the-art lexical exact-match systems, reaching comparable accuracy as lexical all-to-all soft match systems as an efficient exact-match-based system.

Title: Large Language Models Enable Few-Shot Clustering
Year: 2023
Abstract: Unlike traditional unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised clustering allows users to provide meaningful structure to the data, which helps the clustering algorithm to match the user's intent. Existing approaches to semi-supervised clustering require a significant amount of feedback from an expert to improve the clusters. In this paper, we ask whether a large language model can amplify an expert's guidance to enable query-efficient, few-shot semi-supervised text clustering. We show that LLMs are surprisingly effective at improving clustering. We explore three stages where LLMs can be incorporated into clustering: before clustering (improving input features), during clustering (by providing constraints to the clusterer), and after clustering (using LLMs post-correction). We find incorporating LLMs in the first two stages can routinely provide significant improvements in cluster quality, and that LLMs enable a user to make trade-offs between cost and accuracy to produce desired clusters. We release our code and LLM prompts for the public to use.

Title: Prompt2Model: Generating Deployable Models from Natural Language Instructions
Year: 2023
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable system builders today to create competent NLP systems through prompting, where they only need to describe the task in natural language and provide a few examples. However, in other ways, LLMs are a step backward from traditional special-purpose NLP models; they require extensive computational resources for deployment and can be gated behind APIs. In this paper, we propose Prompt2Model, a general-purpose method that takes a natural language task description like the prompts provided to LLMs, and uses it to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment. This is done through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and pretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that given the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that outperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20% while being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to obtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model developers to assess model reliability before deployment. Prompt2Model is available open-source at https://github.com/neulab/prompt2model.

Title: Language-Agnostic Transformers and Assessing ChatGPT-Based Query Rewriting for Multilingual Document-Grounded QA
Year: 2023
Abstract: The DialDoc 2023 shared task has expanded the document-grounded dialogue task to encompass multiple languages, despite having limited annotated data. This paper assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained transformer models in a bi-encoder-based dense passage retriever (DPR), concluding that the language-agnostic approach is superior. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of query rewriting techniques using large language models, such as ChatGPT, on multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems. The experiments conducted demonstrate that, for the examples examined, query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries. This failure is due to topic switching in final dialogue turns and irrelevant topics being considered for query rewriting.

Title: Pre-vaccination CD56 dimCD16 +NK cell abundance and T h1/T h17 ratio predict responsiveness to conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in older adults
Year: 2023
Abstract: 
 Older adults are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) infections. There are two available vaccines for pneumococcus: T-cell-independent capsular polysaccharide Pneumovax and T-cell-dependent conjugated Prevnar. However, how older adults respond to these vaccines at the cellular level and whether there are baseline predictors for responsiveness, is not known. To address this, we recruited older adults (60+ yrs), who are vaccinated with Prevnar (n=19) or Pneumovax (n=20). Vaccine responsiveness was quantified using opsonophagocytic assays, which revealed that both vaccines induce strong responses. Interestingly, sex was associated with Prevnar responses, where women mounted stronger responses than men. Pre-vaccination flow cytometry data showed that Th1 cells positively, Th17 cells negatively correlated with Prevnar responses. Furthermore, bulk RNA-seq data from PBMCs showed that baseline expression levels of cytotoxic genes (NCAM1, GNLY, PRF1) are negatively associated with Prevnar responses. scRNA-seq data from top and bottom responders showed that this cytotoxicity signature stems from CD56 dimCD16 +NK cells, where having more of these cells are detrimental to responses. Interestingly, women had significantly higher Th1, lower Th17 and lower CD16+ NK cells compared to men, which explains their stronger Prevnar responses. This is the first study to uncover older adults’ responses to two pneumococcal vaccines; we uncovered an activated immune phenotype of Th and NK cell subsets that impedes responses to Prevnar. Interestingly, this phenotype only affected adjuvanted vaccine responses, providing an opportunity for precision vaccinology for pneumococcus disease.

11.2 Tuition and Fees   
Information about tuition and fees is available at https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/index.html.  
MSAII students will pay tuition according to the rates set for the School of Computer Science.  
All tuition and fees must be paid in full by the due date; a student not in good financial standing 
will be dismissed from the program. Students taking summer courses must pay tuition.   
11.3 Graduation Ceremonies   
The University holds one Commencement ceremony in May of each year.  Only students who 
have completed their degree requirements may participate in Commencement. 
There are no August or December commencement ceremonies.  
11.3.1 Withdrawal of Degree 
A degree once conferred can be withdrawn by the University under certain circumstances.  See 
the Withdrawal of Degree Policy. 
11.4 LTI Academic Policies 
11.4.1 “Grandfather” policy 
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the 
program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted 
after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, 
the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and 
typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period. 
28 
 
11.4.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption 
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses 
previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the program director, on 
the advice of the faculty member for whose course an exemption is sought. If a student is 
exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that 
course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the exempted course but 
can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student 
receives credit for prior coursework completed at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere, the student 
receives that many units of credit and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by 
that amount.

About Scotty
The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet.
Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church.
The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot.
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.
The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.
The
Scottish terrier breed
is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power and agility in a small package. Many of these traits are also apparent throughout the university, making the Scottish terrier a natural choice for Carnegie Mellon's mascot.

Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon - News - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University ——— Search Search Search this site only News News › Stories › Archives › 2019 › April › Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon April 10, 2019 Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon In its 99th year, the tradition is a Spring Carnival treat By Heidi Opdyke opdyke(through)andrew.cmu.edu Media Inquiries Julie Mattera Marketing and Communications jmattera(through)cmu.edu 412-268-2902 Sweepstakes, also known as the Buggy Races, has come a long way at Carnegie Mellon University. The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago. Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill. But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing. The Machine The basics of a buggy are straightforward, but teams are often secretive in how they build the machines, in particular the way they brake, steer and what types of wheels are used. Each has a body, pushbar for runners to move the machine up the hills, wheels, a safety harness and driving and braking mechanisms. Some also include fairings, a type of housing around the wheels that help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter and just looks cool. Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy. ""We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course,"" said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics. An mural celebrating Buggy can be found in CMU's Stever House. The artwork is part of a larger installation showcasing Sweepstakes and its traditions. Sweepstakes Slang Buggy: Vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the competition.

Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon - News - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University ——— Search Search Search this site only News News › Stories › Archives › 2019 › April › Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon April 10, 2019 Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon In its 99th year, the tradition is a Spring Carnival treat By Heidi Opdyke opdyke(through)andrew.cmu.edu Media Inquiries Julie Mattera Marketing and Communications jmattera(through)cmu.edu 412-268-2902 Sweepstakes, also known as the Buggy Races, has come a long way at Carnegie Mellon University. The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago. Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill. But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing. The Machine The basics of a buggy are straightforward, but teams are often secretive in how they build the machines, in particular the way they brake, steer and what types of wheels are used. Each has a body, pushbar for runners to move the machine up the hills, wheels, a safety harness and driving and braking mechanisms. Some also include fairings, a type of housing around the wheels that help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter and just looks cool. Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy. ""We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course,"" said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics. An mural celebrating Buggy can be found in CMU's Stever House. The artwork is part of a larger installation showcasing Sweepstakes and its traditions. Sweepstakes Slang Buggy: Vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the competition.

About Scotty
The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet.
Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church.
The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot.
In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.
Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.
The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.
The
Scottish terrier breed
is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power and agility in a small package. Many of these traits are also apparent throughout the university, making the Scottish terrier a natural choice for Carnegie Mellon's mascot.

An mural celebrating Buggy can be found in CMU's Stever House. The artwork is part of a larger installation showcasing Sweepstakes and its traditions. Sweepstakes Slang Buggy: Vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the competition. Chute: A section of the freeroll portion of the buggy course (near the southwestern end of Frew Street at its intersection with Schenley Drive) where buggies make the sharp righthand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street. Chute Flagger: Team member who provides a signal for buggy drivers to know when to start the right-hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street. Driver: Person who travels with a buggy and controls the vehicles via steering and braking systems. Pushbar: Structure attached to a buggy that a person pushes to propel that buggy forward. Pusher: Person who propels a buggy via a pushbar along one of the five hills of the buggy course. Shell: Entire outer structure or covering of a buggy that determines that buggy's aerodynamic characteristics. Transition: Procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy. Members of Fringe, celebrating their 50th year of Buggy racing, allowed a rare visit into its shop for a behind-the-scenes tour. This year Fringe is planning to roll four different vehicles, built and maintained in the Fringe workshop in the basement of the East Campus Garage, known as the ""Froom."" ""We're used to saying everything with 'fr' in front of it but when we say something in front of other people, it gets them confused,"" said Fringe head mechanic Dave Singh, who will graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering. Fringe vehicles often are named with the letter ""B,"" like Boson, Blueshift, Bissa and Bumper. Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice. This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.

Kick off your Carnival Weekend with Buggy! View the latest buggy designs, talk with the teams and vote for the Buggy People’s Choice Award. 

Note: No registration required. No event fee. This event is open to the entire CMU community and their guests.
This year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center. It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close. Dave Singh explains how Fringe builds its buggies. Each team keeps its actual processes a secret, but each buggy has certain features such as a body, pushbar, wheels and driving and braking mechanisms. Behind Singh are other buggies built by Fringe. Behind the Wheel Drivers, have the closest connection to the vehicles, aside from the mechanics who spent countless hours building and maintaining individual buggies. While races are brief, each driver must log a number of practice runs to qualify to race. Teams practice nights and weekends throughout the fall and spring semesters as weather permits. Buggies are often built around drivers, so the fit can be snug, and drivers are often less than 5 feet, 3 inches in height. Most — but not all — are women. Tishya Girdhar, a junior in neuroscience, is social chair for Fringe. She came to CMU wanting to drive, but first she had to get over being claustrophobic. She started as a mechanic and got behind the wheel for last year's Sweepstakes. ""Our team's philosophy is to teach everyone how to do everything,"" Girdhar said. ""But I came to CMU wanting to drive. I wanted to drive so badly."" Amy Chen demonstrates how a driver is positioned inside of Boson, a Fringe buggy built in 2016. Safety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed. The streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run. The last course records were set in 2017, but this year potholes are making for some challenging conditions, said Amy Chen, a senior in psychology who has been driving for four years.

Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon - News - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University ——— Search Search Search this site only News News › Stories › Archives › 2019 › April › Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon April 10, 2019 Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon In its 99th year, the tradition is a Spring Carnival treat By Heidi Opdyke opdyke(through)andrew.cmu.edu Media Inquiries Julie Mattera Marketing and Communications jmattera(through)cmu.edu 412-268-2902 Sweepstakes, also known as the Buggy Races, has come a long way at Carnegie Mellon University. The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago. Today, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill. But while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing. The Machine The basics of a buggy are straightforward, but teams are often secretive in how they build the machines, in particular the way they brake, steer and what types of wheels are used. Each has a body, pushbar for runners to move the machine up the hills, wheels, a safety harness and driving and braking mechanisms. Some also include fairings, a type of housing around the wheels that help reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter and just looks cool. Fairings have been a key feature for the Fringe team in recent years, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary of Buggy. ""We have a reputation of being the quietest on the course,"" said Diya Nuxoll, who wrapped up her bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in December and is working on an advanced studies master's degree in design and manufacturing. Nuxoll leads the Fringe team as one of two head mechanics. An mural celebrating Buggy can be found in CMU's Stever House. The artwork is part of a larger installation showcasing Sweepstakes and its traditions. Sweepstakes Slang Buggy: Vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the competition.

It combines a rigorous AI and machine learning curriculum with real-world team experience in identifying an AI market niche and developing a responsive product in cooperation with external stakeholders. The core program, which lasts four semesters and leads to a capstone project, focuses on both intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship, equipping graduates to either begin a startup or develop a new organization within an existing company. Students will also gain critical practical skills, such as making persuasive technical presentations, assembling development teams, and evaluating the potential of new market ideas.

Requirements:
Incoming students generally hold undergraduate degrees in computer science, software engineering, bioinformatics or bioengineering. To earn the MSAII degree, you must pass courses in the Core Curriculum, the Knowledge Requirements and Electives. You must also complete a capstone project in which you work on a development project as part of the Core Curriculum. In total, you will complete 192 eligible units of study, including 84 units of Core Curriculum (including the 36-unit Capstone), 72 units of Knowledge Requirements and at least 36 units of approved Electives.
For full requirements and program details, read the MSAII Handbook.

What are the Core Courses and their sequence in the MSAII program?,"['handbook-msaii-2022-2023.txt', 'program_info_MasterofScienceinArtificialIntelligenceandInnovation.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What are the Core Courses and their sequence in the MSAII program?
Context: This includes any 
AIV letter received in during the summer preceding matriculation. 
A student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances: 
a) A student who has received two Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will be 
terminated.  There are no exceptions and the Program Director has no discretion over 
such a termination as it is an LTI policy. 
b) A student who has received one Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may be 
terminated by the Program Director if the violation is so serious that the student cannot 
be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program. 
c) A student has received three warning letters of any type from the MSAII program. 
d) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is 
provided. 
An AIV letter or violation of University Policy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal 
procedures.  See Section 4.5.2, below.  However, a decision to terminate a student after appeal 
because of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable. 
10.2 Course Requirements  
14 
 
1) Summer Before Entrance  
Admitted students are required to take, pay for, and pass 15-513 Introduction to

It is a long-standing and revered principle of the School of Computer Science (SCS) that 
members of our community are expected to act reasonably, and therefore we try to keep formal, 
written SCS policies to a minimum.  The faculty do not burden the students with numerous 
rules, and, in return, we expect the students to not try to find technical loopholes that violate 
the clear intent of program policies.  In any situation not covered by an explicit rule, you should 
ask yourself how reasonable people would behave in that situation.  The RPP does not alter 
University-wide policies.

One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student’s choice (with approval of the 
Program Director) 
In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a 
similar degree of difficulty may be substituted with the permission of the Director. If a 
15 
 
student has already taken an equivalent course and shows proficiency in the subject 
area, a more advanced course in the area may be taken in place of these required 
courses with permission of the Director.  Graduate students cannot receive credit for 
undergraduate courses.       
 
4) Electives:  
A minimum of 36 units of SCS courses must be taken.  It is recommended to take one 
elective in the first fall semester, one or two in the first spring semester, one or two in 
the second fall semester and zero or one in the second spring semester.  The courses 
below are automatically approved.  A student who wants to take a course not listed 
must obtain approval of the Director prior to registering.  In general, the Director will 
approve any graduate SCS course of not more than 12 units.  It is also possible to seek 
approval for courses in other Colleges at CMU.
See Section 11.1.10, below.   Upon 
completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s 
academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements. 
10.1 Course Grade and GPA Requirements   
To receive the M.S. degree, all students must take and successfully complete at least 195 units 
of coursework. All required Core Courses must be completed with a grade of B or better. For 
the Knowledge Area Courses, students must maintain a B average.  No grade lower than C (or 
Pass in the case of Pass/No Pass courses) shall be used for credit applied toward graduation.  
Under SCS policy, only a grade of C or higher will be regarded as a Pass in a Pass/No Pass 
course.  No undergraduate courses count toward the 195-unit requirement. 
All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order: 
 Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) – No prerequisite. 
 AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or 
better. 
 LTI Practicum (11-935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship. 
 AI Innovation (11-654) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-695 with a grade of “B” or 
better. 
 Capstone (11-699) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-654 with a grade of “B” or better.  
Students are required to repeat any required course that they have completed with a grade less 
than the required minimum, preferably at the next offering. (Please note that Core courses and 
Knowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Students will be allowed to retake a required 
course only once. If a student fails in the second attempt, he or she will be dropped from the 
MSAII program.    
If a student fails an elective course, she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute 
course (equivalent course approved by the Director).    
All grades count towards the program QPA, except for repeated courses, in which case the final 
grade replaces the previous grade.  Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student’s QPA.
Answer: "
How does the MSAII program address academic integrity and what are the consequences of violating it?,"['handbook-msaii-2022-2023.txt', 'handbook-msaii-2022-2023.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: How does the MSAII program address academic integrity and what are the consequences of violating it?
Context: Such 
courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: 
Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only 
if their college’s and department's policies allow this.)  
The MSAII program does not accept transfer credit for courses taken prior to matriculation at 
Carnegie Mellon. 
The MSAII program does not accept distance education credits except for distance courses 
offered by Carnegie Mellon or PCHE institutions. 
10.10 Academic Integrity 
Carnegie Mellon’s Academic Integrity policy is posted at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. All students 
22 
 
are expected to be familiar with this policy, including the university-wide protocol for handling 
academic integrity violations.  The policy includes the University expectations around academic 
integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.  
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures 
(https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html) is also 
recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and 
adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also 
outline the appeal process. 
It is an absolute requirement that the work you submit must be your own, unless you 
specifically identify the source of any material that is not yours.  This includes quotations and 
material from websites.  In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any 
person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that work.  Any student who violates 
the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in 
suspension or expulsion under University policies.  THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE 
FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE 
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.   
You are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them 
as your own work.  Any copied material MUST appear in quotation marks or italics and MUST 
be accompanied by a citation to the original source.  Failure to do this violates CMU’s Policy on 
Academic Integrity, which states, “In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources 
is required.
This includes any 
AIV letter received in during the summer preceding matriculation. 
A student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances: 
a) A student who has received two Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will be 
terminated.  There are no exceptions and the Program Director has no discretion over 
such a termination as it is an LTI policy. 
b) A student who has received one Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may be 
terminated by the Program Director if the violation is so serious that the student cannot 
be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program. 
c) A student has received three warning letters of any type from the MSAII program. 
d) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is 
provided. 
An AIV letter or violation of University Policy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal 
procedures.  See Section 4.5.2, below.  However, a decision to terminate a student after appeal 
because of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable. 
10.2 Course Requirements  
14 
 
1) Summer Before Entrance  
Admitted students are required to take, pay for, and pass 15-513 Introduction to 
Computer Systems OR 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science during the 
summer prior to their arrival at Carnegie Mellon.  The units earned in these courses are 
not counted toward the total number of units required for graduation.  These courses 
may be taken pass/no pass, but cannot be dropped.  A student who drops either course 
during the summer will not be permitted to begin the degree program in the fall, but 
must retake one of the courses the following summer.  The MSAII course offerings are 
available at msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum.  The university’s complete Schedule of 
Classes can be found at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search.

All students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI 
Practicum).  This course can be taken once during the program with Pass/Fail and will be 
counted toward graduation units.  International students must apply for Curricular Practical 
Training (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE).  To 
obtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling out employment dates, work hours, and wages 
or stipend.  It is the student’s responsibility in 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester 
following the internship to all current MSAII students detailing the student’s internship 
experience. 
International students who are interested in working in the U.S after graduation are required to 
consult with the Office of International Education (OIE) which oversees the OPT registration.  
Note: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon. 
NOTE: Students are personally responsible for securing a suitable internship.  The Career and 
Professional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and 
internship opportunity listings in Handshake.  We strongly suggest students begin the 
internship search beginning in the Fall of your first year. Some internship opportunities have 
application deadlines in the Fall, so by starting your search early, you won't miss out on these 
internships.  The Career and Professional Development Center will assist students with the 
internship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is the 
students’ responsibility.   
The following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome.  Many of the 
events below have been modified due to COVID. 
September/October  
 Meet with your advisor to discuss your interests and plan your internship search.  
19 
 
 Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally 
with second-year students who can offer first-hand information about their internships.  
 Attend the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure 
to potential employers for internships.   
November/December  
 Begin researching organizations and internship opportunities. Pay close attention to 
organizations that have established internship programs and their deadlines.  
 Attend workshops to perfect your resume, hone your interviewing skills, and gain 
knowledge about the internship search process.

1 Welcome 
Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, Master of 
Computational Data Science Program. While this handbook is specific to 
your academic experience in the department, there are several other 
resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during 
their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, 
the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, the 
Office of the Dean of Students, and others are included in Appendix A of 
this handbook. 
1.1 The MCDS Degree 
The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) 
degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language 
Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer 
Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students 
with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with 
advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to 
students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, 
programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in 
Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the 
program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and 
students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for 
further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an 
additional fourth semester. 
 
The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; 
students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first 
semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration 
(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in 
consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad 
guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given 
concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program 
is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a 
required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical 
training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the 
LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in 
 
 
7
corporate research and development laboratories. 
 
The program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and 
no Master’s Thesis is required.
Academic Program Name:
Master of Computational Data Science

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mcds.html

Overview:
The MCDS degree focuses on engineering and deploying large-scale information systems. Our comprehensive curriculum equips you with the skills and knowledge to develop the layers of technology involved in the next generation of massive information system deployments and analyze the data these systems generate. When you graduate, you’ll have a unified vision of these systems from your core courses; internship experience; and semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. MCDS graduates are sought-after software engineers, data scientists and project managers at leading information technology, software services and social media companies.

Requirements:
The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
Here are the options:
Standard Timing — a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 48 units. This timing is typical for most students. Students graduate in December.
Extended Timing — a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 36 units. Students graduate in May.
For a complete overview of the MCDS requirements read the MCDS Handbook.

Curriculum:
To earn an MCDS degree, students must pass courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, a concentration area, and electives. Students must also complete a capstone project in which they work on a research project at CMU or on an industry-sponsored project.
In total, students must complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses, and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog.

1.1 The MCDS Degree 
The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) 
degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language 
Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer 
Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students 
with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with 
advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to 
students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, 
programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in 
Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the 
program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and 
students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for 
further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an 
additional fourth semester. 
 
The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; 
students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first 
semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration 
(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in 
consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad 
guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given 
concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program 
is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a 
required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical 
training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the 
LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in 
 
 
7
corporate research and development laboratories. 
 
The program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and 
no Master’s Thesis is required.

Question: What are the MCDS program completion requirements?
Context: Academic Program Name:
Master of Computational Data Science

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mcds.html

Overview:
The MCDS degree focuses on engineering and deploying large-scale information systems. Our comprehensive curriculum equips you with the skills and knowledge to develop the layers of technology involved in the next generation of massive information system deployments and analyze the data these systems generate. When you graduate, you’ll have a unified vision of these systems from your core courses; internship experience; and semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. MCDS graduates are sought-after software engineers, data scientists and project managers at leading information technology, software services and social media companies.

Requirements:
The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
Here are the options:
Standard Timing — a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 48 units. This timing is typical for most students. Students graduate in December.
Extended Timing — a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 36 units. Students graduate in May.
For a complete overview of the MCDS requirements read the MCDS Handbook.

Curriculum:
To earn an MCDS degree, students must pass courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, a concentration area, and electives. Students must also complete a capstone project in which they work on a research project at CMU or on an industry-sponsored project.
In total, students must complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses, and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog.
Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the 
person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently 
offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program. 
 
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, 
family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the 
relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or 
designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that 
interruption. Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all 
semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their 
program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. 
 
3.3.2 Residency requirements 
There is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are 
taught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in-
person course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person.

Question: What is the policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations?
Context: Master’s students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree 
requirements are expected to remain in close contact with their graduate program, and will be 
certified at the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. 
Students shall reference CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations: 
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of limitations.html 
regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the maximum length of 
time allowable for master’s degree completion and certification. 
 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 12 
 
3.2 Statute of Limitations 
As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations, 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-
limitations.html students will complete all requirements for the master’s degree within a 
maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required 
by a more restrictive department, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has 
lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a 
currently offered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program. 
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family 
or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant 
department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer 
the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are 
pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as 
approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of 
the time to degree limit. 
3.3 Additional Guidance for Students 
Program of Study 
Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should 
consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean. 
 
Financial Aid and Student Account 
Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within 
the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, 
student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful 
completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program.
Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible 
as they begin making plans regarding time away.   Students must contact the Office of the Dean 
of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations.  Students will complete an 
information form and meet with a member of Dean’s Office staff to determine resources and 
33 
 
procedures appropriate for the individual student. Planning for the student’s discussion with 
her academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) will be reviewed during this meeting. 
11.6 Statute of Limitations 
As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations, www.cmu.edu/policies/student-
and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html, students must complete all 
requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years from original 
matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school 
or college policy.  Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work 
towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master’s degree program 
under criteria determined by that program. 
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or 
parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's 
recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a 
period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a 
master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their 
program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree 
limit.  
Any request for a waiver of the statute of limitations must be approved by the Department Head 
and by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the 
exceptional circumstances that warrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, 
the waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the 
program.

Question: What is the MCDS Capstone Project?
Context: While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the 
LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in 
 
 
7
corporate research and development laboratories. 
 
The program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and 
no Master’s Thesis is required. All Capstone projects are structured as 
research activities and may lead to a publication. There is no Doctoral 
program in Computational Data Science. Because of the highly selective 
nature of the MCDS program and quality of the MCDS curriculum, 
performing well in the program will give a boost to a PhD application. MS 
graduates are welcome to apply to CMU PhD programs but will not receive 
preferential treatment. 
 
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments 
and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies and 
regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate 
students of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that 
students have written access to the standard information outlined below. 
This handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for 
the Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) degree. 
All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of 
Computer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The 
Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the 
University Policies website. 
1.2 Vision 
Carnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society 
through continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and 
entrepreneurship. 
1.3 Mission 
To create a transformative educational experience for students focused on 
deep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership, 
communication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-
being. 
To cultivate a transformative university community committed to (a) 
attracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a 
collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where 
 
 
8
research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and 
(c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential. 
To impact society in a transformative way — regionally, nationally, and 
globally — by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the 
university campus.
Depending on the concentration, additional learning outcomes are emphasized: 
 
Analytics. Students electing to complete the Analytics concentration will also learn to:  
 
 
Design, implement and evaluate a software system and machine-learning model 
on real world datasets at real world scale.  
 
Analyze and document data science requirements in different application 
domains and survey as well as critique state of the art solutions for those 
requirements. 
 
Systems. Students electing to complete the Systems concentration will also learn to:  
 
 
 
17
 
Implement and evaluate complex, scalable data science systems, with emphasis 
on providing experimental evidence for design decisions. 
 
Anticipate and avert structural and/or implementation problems with systems 
design, especially with scaling and tail distributions. 
 
HCDS. Students electing to complete the Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS) 
concentration will also learn to:  
 
 
Design, implement and evaluate a user experience prototype to allow for clear 
understanding of data science solutions. 
 
Apply social and behavioral research methods to data science problems to 
understand the human aspects of data collection and analysis. 
 
 
Throughout their coursework, students will take introductory courses on all those topics, 
practice them in advanced courses and seminars and demonstrate all learned skills in 
their Capstone project and internship. Students are encouraged to choose elective 
courses in the curriculum according to their professional goals and mastery of the main 
subjects.  
 
3.3.10 Capstone project 
The capstone project consists of students working in a team or individually on a project. 
The capstone project integrates the educational experience of the student. A capstone 
project is typically a CMU research project, or an industry sponsored project; 
occasionally students define capstone topics through communication with the faculty. 
Students interested in defining their own capstone topics should discuss with the MCDS 
faculty as early as possible. The capstone project is a great opportunity for a student (or 
student team) to “show off” their unique skills and accomplishments. Capstone projects 
have been instrumental in the hiring decisions for several employers. 
 
 
3.3.11 Elective courses 
Electives can be any graduate level course (numbered 600 or above) in the School of 
Computer Science. Students use their elective courses to enhance study in an area of 
interest or to explore new areas of interest.

3.3.26 Academic Integrity and Policies on Plagiarism and Cheating 
The university considers any form of cheating or plagiarism to be a serious violation of 
student ethics. The student is required to understand and rigorously follow only the 
permitted forms of collaboration as defined by the instructor in every class. The work 
you submit must be your own, unless you have clearly attributed it to others. You must 
not use the work of others without proper citation. And, you must not use resources, 
including other persons, except as authorized by the course or project for which you are 
submitting the work. Such conduct might be accepted or commonplace elsewhere, but it 
is not here. Be careful. Be warned. Failure to abide by these rules, even just once, can 
result in your permanent separation from the University without refund of money paid. 
Note that the policy requires the student to be informed and understand the academic 
integrity rules for every assignment or exam in a course. 
 
The MCDS program strives to produce graduates with the highest standards of academic 
integrity. Academic Integrity Violations are taken very seriously and the MCDS program 
has a zero tolerance policy for multiple Academic Integrity Violations. A single violation 
is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program if deemed sufficiently egregious as 
determined by the MCDS program committee. If a student commits a second violation, 
the expected penalty is dismissal from the graduate program (see also academic progress 
review at section 3.3.17). 
 
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity: 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html  
The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and 
provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. 
 
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures 
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html  is also 
recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and 
adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures 
also outline the appeal process.
Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for 
Graduate Students describes procedures and the appeal process for disciplinary actions 
against graduate students in cases of alleged academic integrity violation. 
 
For more information on disciplinary actions please see: 
 
https://www.cmu.edu/student-
affairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/disciplinary.html 
 
Further documentation on how to respond to an allegation of a violation as a graduate 
student: 
 
 
26
 
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/grads.html  
 
Important Note: MCDS implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a 
disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program”. We have 
adopted the following hearing procedure and “two strikes” rule: 
 
If an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred, 
both the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation 
to the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this 
purpose. 
 
The program committee then reviews all information and decides whether the 
violation is deemed an infraction (see 3.3.17), and which secondary actions are to 
be taken on the program level. 
 
Two-Strike-Rule: MCDS may dismiss students upon a first AIV infraction. A 
second infraction will always lead to the offending student being dismissed from 
the program, with no exceptions. 
 
The MCDS program reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been 
granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic 
records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, the degree will be withdrawn 
promptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this university 
policy

Question: What are the grading standards for the MCDS program?
Context: 5. Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the 
MCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the 
Director. 
 
Independent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first 
week of classes in a given semester. 
3.3.14 Double counting courses 
No course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course 
satisfy requirements in two degree programs. 
3.3.15 Courses outside of the School of Computer Science 
Elective courses in other Schools at Carnegie Mellon may be taken with prior permission 
of the Director. 
3.3.16 Grades 
All courses offered by the SCS CMU are graded on the 4.3 grading standard  
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html. MCDS students must maintain a 
3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B- 
or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student 
 
 
19
receives a C- or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree 
requirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not 
count towards the MCDS degree. 
 
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of 
enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can 
be requested online through The HUB at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-
records/verifications/ 
3.3.17 Student Review, Academic Probation and Academic Actions 
The MCDS program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each 
semester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding 
the fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity. Should 
a student’s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to 
meet standards and policies established by Carnegie Mellon University, the student may 
be dismissed from the program. 
 
Infractions 
 
After each academic progress review, each student will receive a letter indicating the 
result of the review and their standing in the program.

What degrees does the Language Technologies Institute offer?,"['mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt', 'handbook_phd_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What degrees does the Language Technologies Institute offer?
Context: 1.2 The MLT Degree 
The Master of Language Technologies (MLT) is a research-oriented Master of Science degree 
offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI), a graduate department in the School of 
Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.  The MLT program is a 24-month program 
consisting of courses, directed research, and an optional Masters' Thesis.  Typical research 
areas include speech processing, information retrieval, machine translation, natural language 
processing, machine learning, and computational biology.  Many MLT graduates continue on to 
PhD programs in the LTI or other leading universities.  Other graduates go on to work in the 
computer industry, many at major corporate research laboratories. 
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in 
philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a 
handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and 
ensures that students have written access to the standard information outlined below. This 
handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Master of Language 
Technologies (MLT) degree. 
While this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the department, there are 
several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their 
tenure at Carnegie Mellon University.  Information about The Word, Carnegie Mellon University 
Student Handbook, the Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education, the Office 
of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are included in Appendix A of this handbook. 
All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science 
(SCS) policies and university policies described in The Word, Carnegie Mellon University Student 
Handbook and at the University Policies website.
For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and 
policies, please see the universitys handbook The Word, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral 
Affairs web page, the Office of the Dean of Students web page, and other resources contained in 
Appendix A of this handbook. 
Welcome! We hope that your time here is a life-changing experience.

Question: What is the target duration for completing the LTI Ph.D. program?
Context: 4 
Ph.D. Academic Policies 
4.1 
Duration of Study 
The target duration of the LTI Ph.D. is five years, although six years is also common. 
Carnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements within 
the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in this Graduate Student 
Handbook. Upon completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be 
certified by the students academic program in the semester in which the student completes the 
requirements. 
Early Completion 
The Ph.D. is granted when all degree requirements are satisfied. Some students complete the 
program in fewer than five years. 
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 24 
 
Extended or Longer-than-Standard Competition 
Longer-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in making 
progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions of full-time study 
or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical issues, or other unusual or 
unforeseen circumstances. 
Doctoral students who require an extended period to complete their degree requirements must 
consult with their academic program and are subject to the CMU Policy on Doctoral Student 
Status (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/doctoral-student-status.html), 
specifically the Time to Degree. 
4.1.1 Department Policy on Double Counting Courses 
An LTI Ph.D. student who uses courses taken as a Masters degree student (at Carnegie Mellon 
or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward any 
other Masters degree offered by the school. The LTI (like other SCS units) allows its Ph.D. 
students who have passed the requirements for an LTI Masters degree to receive the masters 
degree without any additional work. Any other sharing of coursework by an LTI student between 
more than one CMU degree (e.g., receiving an MLD Masters degree that includes courses taken 
as an LTI Ph.D. student) must be explicitly approved by the LTI, on a case-by-case basis, in 
advance.  
4.1.2 External Internships  
The LTI provides summer support for its Ph.D. students, so Ph.D. students are expected to do 
research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, outside experience can be a valuable 
educational experience, Ph.D.
Students who fail to complete the Form I-9 in a timely manner may have stipend payments 
suspended.  If employed by the university, an individual who fails to timely complete the 
Form I-9 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of 
employment. 
For more information: 
 See CMUs Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU, 
or

Additional Guidance for Students 
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 23 
 
3.11.1 Program of Study  
Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree requirements should consult 
with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean. 
3.11.2 Financial Aid and Student Account  
Students are expected to make normal progress toward their degree in order to graduate within 
the standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, 
student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful 
completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To receive 
the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students must enroll 
each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See separate 
guidance regarding integrated degree completion.)  
Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and 
financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated 
undergraduate and masters degree programs.    
3.11.3 International Students 
Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making normal 
progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are 
considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard 
completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated 
undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of 
International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.

Answer: "
What are the proficiency requirements for the LTI Ph.D. students?,"['handbook_phd_2023-2024.txt', 'handbook_phd_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What are the proficiency requirements for the LTI Ph.D. students?
Context: 3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements 
The LTI Ph.D. does not require any Qualifying Exams. Instead, a LTI Ph.D. student is required to 
demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas. 
 Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper, or the 
equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-
paper quality). 
 
 Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the 
equivalent (an oral presentation that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of 
conference-talk quality). 
 
 Programming: This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming 
of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research 
and/or project work. 
 
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 16 
 
 Teaching: This is satisfied by two (2) successful Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships), as 
determined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA. Typically, one of 
these will be for an undergraduate class, and one for a graduate-level class. One of the two 
TA-ships may be in some form of pre-approved ""alternate service"", such as an SCS v-unit.  
 
The Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of a TA-ship, or it may not be accepted.  
Graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct 
in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this 
Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English 
fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full university 
policy can be reviewed at:  
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html 
The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student 
Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.  
In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory 
screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student Academic 
Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency 
and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon.
Unless otherwise specified, ""course"" means an actual 
classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI allows 
any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an ""LTI course"".  
An SCS course is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of 
Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as one-half of an 
SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, ""course"" means an actual classroom course, not credit 
given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended electives that are technically 
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 15 
 
outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for example, Digital Signal Processing in 
ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as SCS.  
LTI Focus Areas are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under Course 
Categories. If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they should make 
a request to the Ph.D. Program Director. They will decide, with advice from faculty in the 
appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area. If approved, it will be added to the LTI 
Focus Area webpage.  
A Task-Orientation Focus Course is a course belonging to that LTI Focus Area, as listed on 
the LTIs Course Categories webpage.  
An LTI lab course is a course in the list of lab courses defined on the LTIs Course Categories 
webpage. 
3.1.2 Grade Requirements 
Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in 
applying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements. 
Minimum grade: Only courses with a grade of B (3.0) or higher are counted as satisfying a degree 
requirement. 
Pass/fail: Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree 
requirement. 
3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements 
The LTI Ph.D. does not require any Qualifying Exams. Instead, a LTI Ph.D. student is required to 
demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas.

Financial Support 
5.1 
Graduate Student Funding  
For all LTI Ph.D. students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This 
support is normally continued for at least 5 years, with possibility of further continuance, subject 
to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition 
and fees, and a monthly Ph.D. stipend that is fixed across SCS. In addition, the LTI pays a 
dependency allowance of 10% of the student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless 
they have a spouse who earns more than $200 per month. 
The impact of outside fellowships and scholarships on departmental support-decrease by the 
amount, added bonus, etc. 
If a Ph.D. student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is 
expected to accept it in place of the LTIs graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, the 
LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined stipend 
10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship.  
Students are required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive. 
See also the section on ABD versus ABD in Absentia (ABS) (Section 4.3.3).  
5.2 
Conference Travel Funding  
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 33 
 
Students funded by research projects receive travel funding according to policies set by the 
individual projects. Students who have no project funding may be provided with partial funding, 
with a larger amount available for travel to present a refereed conference paper. There is an LTI 
form that must be filled out in advance. 
5.3 
Research Funding 
GuSH Research Funding is a source of small research grant funds provided by the Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA) and the Provosts Office and managed by the Office of Graduate and 
Postdoc Affairs.
4.1.2 External Internships  
The LTI provides summer support for its Ph.D. students, so Ph.D. students are expected to do 
research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, outside experience can be a valuable 
educational experience, Ph.D. students in good standing are allowed to do an external internship. 
Some students may benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to 
proprietary data for their work, thus, with the approval of the students advisor, a student can intern up 
to four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree. Interning more than four (4) times requires approval 
from the Ph.D. Program Director. 
Any internship must be planned in consultation with the students advisor and the LTI Ph.D. 
Coordinator. If an internship is part of a fully-funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research 
Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their 
advisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for 
eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.  
Internships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases, it is possible to schedule 
an internship during the fall or spring semester; the details are complex, especially for 
international students, so the student should discuss this as early as possible with the Ph.D. 
Program Director. International students must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due 
to visa restrictions.  
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 25 
 
Note that self-funded Ph.D. students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester 
internship) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while 
full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend.  
All students are cautioned to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with 
internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible 
to lose ownership of your ideas.  
If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the 
student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking.

6.5 Health Insurance  
Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking 
students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered 
by the University, or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is enrolled as the 
dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance 
plan (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at 
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StudentInsurance).  
The LTI does not cover student health insurance, regardless of the students funding situation. 
It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to 
either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over 
the course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services 
Web site www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/HealthServices/insurance.

Answer: "
What are the conditions under which an LTI Ph.D. student can do an external internship?,"['handbook_phd_2023-2024.txt', 'handbook_phd_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What are the conditions under which an LTI Ph.D. student can do an external internship?
Context: 4.1.2 External Internships  
The LTI provides summer support for its Ph.D. students, so Ph.D. students are expected to do 
research at Carnegie Mellon during the summer. However, outside experience can be a valuable 
educational experience, Ph.D. students in good standing are allowed to do an external internship. 
Some students may benefit from more than one internship, especially if they require access to 
proprietary data for their work, thus, with the approval of the students advisor, a student can intern up 
to four (4) times during their Ph.D. degree. Interning more than four (4) times requires approval 
from the Ph.D. Program Director. 
Any internship must be planned in consultation with the students advisor and the LTI Ph.D. 
Coordinator. If an internship is part of a fully-funded external fellowship (e.g., Microsoft Research 
Fellowship), the student does not need prior LTI approval, but should still coordinate with their 
advisor. International students must consult with Office of International Education (OIE) for 
eligibility before seeking an internship or signing an offer contract.  
Internships are typically scheduled during the summer. In certain cases, it is possible to schedule 
an internship during the fall or spring semester; the details are complex, especially for 
international students, so the student should discuss this as early as possible with the Ph.D. 
Program Director. International students must coordinate carefully with the LTI in any event, due 
to visa restrictions.  
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 25 
 
Note that self-funded Ph.D. students (e.g., those registered for five units while on semester 
internship) are not permitted to receive a partial stipend for the semester of their internship, while 
full-time LTI-sponsored students are eligible for a partial stipend.  
All students are cautioned to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with 
internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is possible 
to lose ownership of your ideas.  
If the student is to receive academic credit for the internship, it must have deliverables from the 
student commensurate with the number of units, they are taking.
4.1.8 Transferring Out of the Ph.D. Program 
The Ph.D. program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. A 
student who is interested in transferring out of the Ph.D. degree program should consult the 
handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether transfers are 
permitted, and if so, how, and when to request such a transfer. 
4.2 
LTI Academic Policies 
4.2.1 Grandfather Policy 
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the 
program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted after 
the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, the 
department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and typically 
arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period of time. 
4.2.2 Definition of Transfer Credit vs. Course Exemption 
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses previously 
completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the particular program.  
If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can 
replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the external 
course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place.  
If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the student 
receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by that 
amount. 
4.2.3 External Employment/Consulting 
Students funded by LTI research projects are expected to work primarily for those projects. Since 
consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most one 
day per seven-day week, with the advisor's consent. International students must also have 
approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE); otherwise, they may be in 
violation of their visa status. See also External Internships. 
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 27 
 
4.2.4 Leave of Absence 
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite good 
intentions.

How long is the MLT program expected to take?,"['program_info_MasterofLanguageTechnologies.txt', 'mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: How long is the MLT program expected to take?
Context: Academic Program Name:
Master of Language Technologies

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mlt.html

Overview:
The MLT program prepares students for a research career in academia or industry. In this program, you’ll be immersed in research for two full years. During the academic year, your time will be evenly split between taking courses and doing research with your faculty advisor. Your summer will be devoted entirely to research. Many MLT grads continue on to Ph.D. programs at CMU and other top institutions, while others pursue careers at companies emphasizing research and rapid innovation.

Requirements:
The MLT program lasts two years (24 months), and students must complete two summers of research. Students should usually expect to graduate in August of their second year.
MLT students take 120 or more course units (about 10 courses), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. Most of these are 12-unit courses, although lab courses are typically 6 units. Our courses generally assume knowledge of programming and data structures. The remaining units may also be taken from the LTI, or with approval from the faculty advisor, any other senior- or graduate-level course offered at CMU or Pitt.
Directed research is another integral part of the MLT program; MLT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors.
Students may also choose to complete an optional MLT thesis. Guidelines can be found in the MLT Handbook.

Curriculum:
Here's an example of how your two years in the MLT program may break down.
In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student 
to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is 
the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action. 
 
The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of 
academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate 
Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of 
alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.  Please see 
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/ for more information. 
Important note:  The LTI implements the above policys option of conven[ing] a disciplinary 
hearing according to the procedures of the department/program. Our procedure is as follows: 
a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to 
immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. 
If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the 
graduate program. 
5 Academic Policies 
5.1 MLT Academic Policies 
5.1.1 Duration of Study 
MLT students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in two calendar 
years (24 months). This includes two summers of full-time directed research. 
See also the Statute of Limitations policy. 
5.1.2 Double-Dipping 
A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie 
Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses 
MLT Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 21 
 
toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior 
approval. This is an SCS-wide policy. 
5.1.3 Pass/Fail Grades 
Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate 
students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core 
foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses. 
5.1.4 Independent Study 
For an Independent Study to satisfy an MLT students coursework requirements, it must be 
approved by the MLT Program Director in advance.

University Policy on Grades .
It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in 
their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time. 
4.3 Optional Masters Thesis 
MLT students may optionally elect to complete a Masters Thesis; it is not required. Students 
who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several 
ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in 
a research project or class project work. 
The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the 
October 31 proposal deadline! 
 There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. 
Thesis: 11-928  Masters Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, 
typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11-929  Masters Thesis II in the following 
Spring. 
 Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit; if the 
student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11-929) counts towards one PhD lab 
requirement.   
 The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant 
implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their advisor to 
define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in 
MLT Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 16 
 
a publication-quality paper that clearly describes the work in terms of its research 
significance. 
 The MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor and two additional 
readers, to be chosen by the student in consultation with the advisor, during the Fall 
Masters Thesis I course. At least 2 of the 3 committee members must be SCS faculty 
working in Language Technologies. 
 To receive a final grade for the first semester's course, the student must have prepared 
a written proposal of at least five pages, describing the scientific thesis to be 
investigated, any relevant research already completed by the student, a comparison 
with related work by others, and a detailed description of the work to be done in the 
next semester. The proposal MUST be accepted by the committee by the end of 
October, or the student will not be allowed to enroll in 11-929  Masters Thesis II!

Question: What is the research speaking requirement for MLT students?
Context: For definitions of quoted terms, see the section on Definitions of LTI Terminology. 
Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be 
satisfied by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study. 
MLT Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 14 
 
Note that a Masters Thesis is not required in general, although a thesis project may be used to 
satisfy the lab requirement. 
 
4.1.1 Grade Requirements 
Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in 
applying their skills in directed study by satisfying the following grade requirements: 
1. Minimum grade:  Only courses with a grade of C (2.0) or higher are counted as satisfying 
a degree requirement. 
2. Pass/fail:  Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a 
degree requirement. 
4.1.2 Research Speaking Requirement 
To emphasize student research, improve public speaking skills, and increase internal awareness 
of LTI work, all MLT students must complete an oral presentation in their second year (by the 
end of May). The presentation should consist of a 20-minute talk plus time for discussion. It 
must be advertised to the LTI mailing lists at least one week before your presentation, and the 
public will be invited. 
At least two CMU faculty members will attend the presentation, including the research advisor. 
After the presentation, these faculty members will convene and provide written feedback to 
both the student and the chair of graduate programs (the form for this is available on the LTI 
website). This feedback will help the student refine speaking skills with respect to talk structure, 
content, and delivery. 
4.1.3 Withdrawal of a Degree 
The University reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should 
there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of 
it had been falsified. In such a case, withdrawal of the degree will occur promptly upon 
discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this University policy is available at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html.  
4.2 Advising 
Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the 
progress of the student through the program.

What is the policy on external internships for MLT students?,"['mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt', 'mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What is the policy on external internships for MLT students?
Context: 5.1.4 Independent Study 
For an Independent Study to satisfy an MLT students coursework requirements, it must be 
approved by the MLT Program Director in advance.  In consultation with the CMU faculty 
member who will be supervising the Independent Study, the student should produce a short 
(half-page to one page) description of the goals of the Independent Study, and how the results 
will be evaluated, and submit it to the Program Director before the end of the Add period of the 
semester of the proposed study. The study should be planned so that it is finished in time for 
the supervising faculty member to give a grade at the end of the semester.  Independent 
studies may be undertaken for 6 or 12 units. Normally only one Independent Study would be 
approved during a students MLT coursework. 
5.1.5 Transfer Credit 
An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to 
satisfy one of the MLT course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be 
transferred is made by the MLT Program Director. Typically, the student will provide the 
Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use 
that and the students transcript to make the decision.  
See the section on Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption. 
All MLT students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.  
5.1.6 External Internships 
MLT students may only engage in internships if their advisors recommend it, since the program 
is 24 months, including summers. International students are required to consult with the Office 
of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer 
contract. 
We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with 
internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is 
possible to lose ownership of your ideas. 
Important: See also section 4.2.3, External Employment/Consulting.

5.1.7 Transferring Into the MLT Program 
Transfers into the MLT program are not permitted during a students first semester at CMU. 
Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this is a university 
policy.

What is the MLT student policy on transferring into or out of the MLT program?,"['mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt', 'mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What is the MLT student policy on transferring into or out of the MLT program?
Context: Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this is a university 
policy. 
Students may request to transfer into the MLT program after completing their first semester. 
The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MLT/PhD Admissions Chair. The 
MLT/PhD Admissions Chair will inform the student about what application materials are 
required; for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a 
proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree 
program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from 
other universities. The MLT program will conduct an expedited admissions process after 
receiving such a request.   
5.1.8 Transferring Out of the MLT Program 
The MLT program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. 
Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are 
permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MLT degree program should 
consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether 
transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer. 
5.1.9 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures 
Students taking undergraduate and Masters level courses must follow the procedures and 
deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic 
calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-
changes.index. Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not 
apply to Masters students. 
5.1.10  Statute of Limitations 
As outlined in the Masters Students Statute of Limitations, 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- 
limitations.html. Students will complete all requirements for the masters degree within a 
maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a masters student, or less if required by 
a more restrictive department, school, or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has 
lapsed, the person may resume work towards a masters degree only if newly admitted to a 
currently offered masters degree program under criteria determined by that program.

Answer: "
How does the MLT program address academic integrity?,"['mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt', 'mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: How does the MLT program address academic integrity?
Context: The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: 
Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program 
will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will 
be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such 
courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors, or QPA calculations. (Note: 
Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit 
only if their colleges and department's policies allow this.) 
4.10 Academic Integrity 
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity: 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html 
The policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides 
definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. 
A review of the Universitys Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures is also recommended. 
These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and adjudicating violations of 
the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also outline the appeals process. 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html 
In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can 
create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic 
challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively 
reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It is 
the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our 
university. 
MLT Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 20 
 
Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve 
society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and 
expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the 
changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to 
create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching 
and learning and transfer to society; to serve students by teaching them leadership, problem-
solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and 
commitments to work; and to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open 
to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.
In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student 
to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is 
the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action. 
 
The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of 
academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate 
Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of 
alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.  Please see 
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/ for more information. 
Important note:  The LTI implements the above policys option of conven[ing] a disciplinary 
hearing according to the procedures of the department/program. Our procedure is as follows: 
a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program. If we decide not to 
immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary probation. 
If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is dismissal from the 
graduate program. 
5 Academic Policies 
5.1 MLT Academic Policies 
5.1.1 Duration of Study 
MLT students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in two calendar 
years (24 months). This includes two summers of full-time directed research. 
See also the Statute of Limitations policy. 
5.1.2 Double-Dipping 
A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie 
Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses 
MLT Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 21 
 
toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior 
approval. This is an SCS-wide policy. 
5.1.3 Pass/Fail Grades 
Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree requirement. Graduate 
students who are required to take additional undergraduate courses to build up the core 
foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail option for these courses. 
5.1.4 Independent Study 
For an Independent Study to satisfy an MLT students coursework requirements, it must be 
approved by the MLT Program Director in advance.

What financial support is available for MLT students?,"['mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt', 'mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What financial support is available for MLT students?
Context: Formal Leave of Absence - A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave 
Policy. Generally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of 
absence for a full-semester, mini-semester, or for the time remaining in the 
semester during which the leave is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of 
Absence (https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-
leave.html) drop all remaining courses for the semester and are unenrolled for 
the semester. International students must consult with the Office of 
International Education (https://www.cmu.edu/oie/) before considering this 
option due to visa implications. 
Financial Assistance for Student Parents 
Carnegie Mellon also offers the following options for financial assistance to students who 
become parents while enrolled: 
Interest-free Loan  Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an interest-free 
parental loan (https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/) from the Office of the Dean 
of Students. 
6 Financial Issues 
6.1 Graduate Student Funding  
For all LTI MLT students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This 
support is normally continued for the duration of the program, subject to continuing 
satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, 
and a monthly MLT stipend. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the 
student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns 
more than $200 per month. 
If an MLT student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is 
expected to accept it in place of the LTIs graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, 
the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined 
MLT Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 28 
 
stipend 10 percent higher than that of the standard LTI graduate fellowship. Students are 
required to inform the LTI about any external funding that they receive. 
6.2 University Financial Aid 
Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The 
HUB website: http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/graduate/index.html.

What is the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) degree?,"['program_info_MasterofScienceinIntelligentInformationSystems.txt', 'miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What is the Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS) degree?
Context: Academic Program Name:
Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/miis.html

Overview:
The Master's in Intelligent Information Systems degree focuses on recognizing and extracting meaning from text, spoken language and video. As an MIIS student, you’ll receive the department’s deepest exposure to content analysis and machine learning. In addition to completing the program’s coursework, you’ll work on directed study projects with your faculty advisor for two semesters; participate in a summer internship; and collaborate with your peers on a semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. This combination of classroom instruction, professional experience, and using new skills in significant projects with world-class colleagues will help prepare you for a successful career in industry or government. Our alumni have gone on to exciting careers at places like Apple, IBM and Google, and most have job offers within six weeks of graduation.

Requirements:
The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.
MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:
Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.
Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.
MIIS: Advanced Study track offers an in-depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:
Human Language for Language Technologies
Language Technology Application
Machine Learning for Language Technologies
Part-time education option is available in some cases.
MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements.

Question: How long does it take to complete the MIIS degree?
Context: degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior 
approval. (SCS policy) 
6.1.2 Duration of Study 
MIIS-16 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in three 
semesters of academic study and one summer internship (16 months total).  
MIIS-21 students enrolled for full-time study are expected to complete the degree in four 
semesters of academic study and one summer internship (21 months total).  
MIIS-16 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in six 
semesters of academic study and one summer internship (27 months total).   
MIIS-21 students enrolled for part-time study are expected to complete the program in seven 
semesters of academic study and one summer internship (31 months total). 
See also the ‘Statute of Limitations’ policy. 
6.1.3 Deferral 
MIIS students are given the opportunity to defer their enrollment. The deferral request must 
be approved by the program director. The deferral can only be used once for the period of one 
academic year. 
6.1.4 Maximum and Minimum Course Loads 
A student in the program may not take more than sixty (60) units per semester without 
permission from the program director. 
A student in the program must be registered for a minimum thirty-six (36) units per semester 
to be considered a full-time student or twelve (12) units per semester to be considered a part-
time student. All international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time 
status. Reduced Course Load is not permitted for MIIS students. Failure to maintain full-time 
status will result in loss of a student visa (and, therefore, “permit of stay”). (MIIS policy) 
6.1.5 Transfer Credit 
An equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another 
institution may be permitted to satisfy one of the MIIS breadth requirements. The decision on 
whether a course may be used to satisfy a breadth requirement is made by the MIIS Program

Director. Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the 
external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make 
the decision.
Academic Program Name:
Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/miis.html

Overview:
The Master's in Intelligent Information Systems degree focuses on recognizing and extracting meaning from text, spoken language and video. As an MIIS student, you’ll receive the department’s deepest exposure to content analysis and machine learning. In addition to completing the program’s coursework, you’ll work on directed study projects with your faculty advisor for two semesters; participate in a summer internship; and collaborate with your peers on a semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. This combination of classroom instruction, professional experience, and using new skills in significant projects with world-class colleagues will help prepare you for a successful career in industry or government. Our alumni have gone on to exciting careers at places like Apple, IBM and Google, and most have job offers within six weeks of graduation.

Requirements:
The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.
MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:
Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.
Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.
MIIS: Advanced Study track offers an in-depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:
Human Language for Language Technologies
Language Technology Application
Machine Learning for Language Technologies
Part-time education option is available in some cases.
MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements.

What are the core requirements for the MIIS degree?,"['miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt', 'miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What are the core requirements for the MIIS degree?
Context: Curricular requirements ensure that MIIS students receive 
instruction in core intelligent information systems technologies while also allowing an 
opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest. Practice requirements are opportunities 
to apply and hone new skills while building state-of-the-art systems. Grade requirements ensure 
that students have demonstrated a certain level of skill while completing degree requirements. 
All three types of requirements are described below. 
MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 12-unit courses) of qualifying and 
elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology 
applications breadth requirements and 66 practice units for a total of 150 units to attain the 
Standard MIIS degree. 
MIIS-21 students must take at least 108 units (typically 9 12-unit courses) of qualifying and 
elective courses and 66 practice units to satisfy their degree requirements, making it a total of 
174 units to attain the MIIS: Advanced Study degree. 
4.3 Core Requirements 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 14 
 
A MIIS student must complete the following curricular requirements: 
1. Qualifying courses:  
MIIS-16 students must pass 72 units (typically 6 12-unit courses) and MIIS-21 students 
must complete 96 units (typically 8 12-unit courses) in qualifying master’s courses.  
A qualifying master’s course is defined as:  
a. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies 
Institute; and 
b. Any graduate course (600-level or higher) from the list of approved qualifying 
courses (Section 3.2.4). 
2. Free elective: Students must pass 12 units (typically 1 course) in elective master’s 
course(s). A free elective is defined as:  
a. A graduate course (600-level or higher) with content relevant to the MIIS 
program objectives offered by the School of Computer Science; and 
b. A course approved by the student's advisor and the degree Program Director. 
c. A student may not use the same course to satisfy both a qualifying course 
requirement and an elective course requirement. 
3. Breadth requirements: Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in 
each of the following areas.
Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, 
student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful 
completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To 
receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students 
must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See 
separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their 
designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early 
completion, longer-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree 
programs.   
 
International Students 
Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrant status is tied to making normal 
progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are 
considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard 
completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated 
undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of 
International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.

4.5 Practice Requirements 
A student must complete at least 66 practice-oriented course units and satisfy the following 
practice-oriented requirements for both MIIS-16 and MIIS-21 programs. 
1. Directed study requirement: Students must pass 24 units (typically 12 units x 2 
semesters) in directed study under the supervision of their advisor. Directed study is a 
structured, task-oriented form of independent study that provides deep, hands-on 
experience in a particular technology area and an opportunity to work closely with a 
member of the faculty. 
2. Internship requirement: Students must complete a one-semester (typically summer) 
internship at an organization (typically a company or government agency) approved by 
the MIIS Program Director. Internships are an opportunity to apply new skills in a 
professional setting and to learn about software development in a ‘real world’ 
organization. Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS 
Program Director to waive this requirement.  
MIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present 
their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester.
Answer: "
Can MIIS students transfer courses from other institutions?,"['miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt', 'miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: Can MIIS students transfer courses from other institutions?
Context: Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the 
external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make 
the decision.  
Satisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the 
number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree.  
See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption” on page 25. 
6.1.6 Transferring into the MIIS Program 
Transfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student’s first semester at CMU.  
Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them. 
Students may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester 
and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester.  The student must make the request 
in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director.  The MIIS Program Director will inform 
the student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why 
a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts.  
Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE 
and TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.   
The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a 
request.  The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the 
transfer will allow the student to be “on schedule” by the end of the spring semester, so that 
the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall 
semester. 
MIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after 
beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed within the 
first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than 
once! Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration 
records of international students. Students also must understand that extension of their stay 
in the program will lead to additional financial obligations.  
U.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for 
a legitimate reason.
For many graduate degree programs, there is an 
expectation that graduate students continue research during academic breaks and time away 
from campus which may or may not be negotiated with the students. If there are requirements 
for student time beyond a typical week day, this should be specified. Clarify that University 
Holidays are also student holidays, and students need to consult their faculty about coverage if 
they have challenges with taking time off during University Holidays. For example, if 
experiments are running that need to be monitored continuously students should speak with 
their faculty about arrangements to take an equal number of days off at another time. 
6.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption 
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses 
previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the director of the 
program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the 
student can replace that course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for 
the external course but can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its 
place. If a student receives credit for prior coursework completed at CMU or elsewhere, the 
student receives that many units of credit, and the total amount of required coursework is 
reduced by that amount. 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 27 
 
6.2.5 External Employment/Consulting 
Since the MIIS program places heavy demands on student time, external employment and/or 
consulting are strongly discouraged. Exceptional students who wish to consult should discuss 
this with their Advisor. International students must also have approval in advance from the 
Office of International Education (OIE) for any outside employment. 
6.2.6 Leave of Absence 
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA), since students usually do not return, despite 
good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 1 year, 
upon written request to the Program Director and with consent of the student's advisor. It is 
the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to the program.

Question: How does the MIIS program handle internships?
Context: All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, 
but without grades. Such courses will not be considered for academic actions, honors or QPA 
calculations. 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-
assignment.html 
 
NOTE: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer 
credit only if their college’s and department's policies allow this. 
4.9 Internships 
If the experience will have units attached to it, the program should have deliverables from the 
student commensurate with the number of units they are taking. This can be in the form of 
interim and final reports on the experience, presentations in the following semester regarding 
the experience, assessments of their experience as it relates to their course of study, etc. 
Students are responsible for identifying and applying for internships on their own.  The LTI and 
the university provide several types of support for students seeking internships.   
An annual poster session helps spread information from MIIS students that recently completed 
internships to MIIS students that will soon seek internships; other LTI professional master’s 
programs have similar internship-oriented poster sessions that MIIS students may attend. The 
university offers resume-writing and interviewing workshops to help prepare students and fall 
and spring employment fairs to help students connect with companies.  The university’s Career 
& Professional Development Center https://www.cmu.edu/career/ provides other services as 
well. 
If a student cannot find an internship, the MIIS program will arrange an on-campus internship 
with a university-based project.  This internship may be unpaid. 
International students are required to consult with Office of International Education for 
eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer contract (required addition to 
ensure the university is in compliance with immigration laws for F & J status students). 
4.10 Advising 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 19 
 
Each student has a faculty advisor charged with guiding the education and monitoring the 
progress of the student through the program. The advisor also supervises the student's directed 
study projects. This personal student-advisor relationship ensures that every student receives 
the necessary faculty mentoring. The advisor also provides the student with career advice. 
How and when the advisor is selected: Advisors are selected during the first month of the 
program.
Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS 
Program Director to waive this requirement.  
MIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present 
their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester.  The 
poster and the student’s participation in the poster session are part of the internship 
requirement.  Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program 
Director. 
3. Capstone requirements: Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a 
capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students 
experience with collaborative, team-oriented software development; significant hands-
on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work 
on a large software application.  
a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group-oriented demonstration of 
student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically, the result of 
the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is 
supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly 
basis to monitor progress and provide guidance. 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 17 
 
b. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines 
capstone project goals, requirements, success metrics, and deliverables; and 
identifies and acquires data, software, and other resources required for successful 
completion of the project. The planning seminar must be completed in the 
semester prior to taking the capstone project. 
4.6 Registration Process/Procedures 
Students are responsible for registering for their courses. Use the Stellic Degree Audit 
Application to monitor your progress and plan your degree. Students can search for relevant 
courses in a number of ways and share your plan with your advisor directly through the 
application.

Question: What academic policies apply to MIIS students?
Context: The course includes several administrative tasks, 
training, and educational sessions. The students will be enrolled into the course by the 
program administrator in early August. All MIIS students are expected to complete all 
assignments by the end of their first semester in the program. Each assignment has its own due 
date.  
4.12 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures 
Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance 
Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 20 
 
processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. 
Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the 
applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal 
resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the 
matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures 
shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the 
department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about 
the administration and academic policies of the program. 
Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures - Office of Graduate and 
Postdoctoral Affairs - Carnegie Mellon University (cmu.edu) 
4.13 Intellectual Property Policy 
The MIIS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual 
property: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html 
5 Grading and Evaluation 
5.1 Grading Scale/System 
Students must demonstrate their mastery of material taught in courses and their success in 
applying their skills in directed study and capstone projects by satisfying the following grade 
requirements: 
1. Minimum grade:   A student must obtain a B- or better grade in all courses, which count 
towards core requirements. If a student receives a C or better, that course may count as an 
elective towards the degree requirements. 
2. Minimum QPA:  A student must maintain an average QPA of at least 3.0 in courses and 
projects used to satisfy degree requirements. 
3. Pass/fail:  Pass/fail grades are not permitted for courses and projects used to satisfy a degree 
requirement.
This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent ""black mark"" 
on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no 
official record of the letter in the student's transcript. 
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of 
conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all the specified 
conditions may result in the student's termination from the program. 
5.8 Satisfactory Progress 
If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, 
the LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage the student to 
consider switching to the four-semester program (MIIS-21) to complete all the requirements. 
5.9 Academic Integrity 
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. The policy 
includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of 
cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. 
 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 23 
 
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures  
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also 
recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and 
adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also 
outline the appeal process. 
 
In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can 
create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic 
challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively 
reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It 
is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our 
university. 
Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve 
society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and 
expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society.

What financial support is available for MIIS students?,"['miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt', 'miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What financial support is available for MIIS students?
Context: Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, 
student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in and successful 
completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current degree program. To 
receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they may be eligible, students 
must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their current degree level. (See 
separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.) Students should consult with their 
designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early 
completion, longer-than standard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree 
programs.   
 
International Students 
Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 nonimmigrant status is tied to making normal 
progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students who are 
considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-than-standard 
completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification (integrated 
undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the Office of 
International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations.

Answer: "
What is the MIIS policy on academic integrity?,"['miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt', 'miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What is the MIIS policy on academic integrity?
Context: This type of letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent ""black mark"" 
on the student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no 
official record of the letter in the student's transcript. 
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student an N-1 letter that specifies a list of 
conditions that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all the specified 
conditions may result in the student's termination from the program. 
5.8 Satisfactory Progress 
If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, 
the LTI may remove the student from the program or strongly encourage the student to 
consider switching to the four-semester program (MIIS-21) to complete all the requirements. 
5.9 Academic Integrity 
Please review the University Policy on Academic Integrity 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. The policy 
includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides definitions of 
cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. 
 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 23 
 
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures  
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html is also 
recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and 
adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also 
outline the appeal process. 
 
In the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic environment can 
create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good judgment. Academic 
challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to evolve if students actively 
reflect on these challenges and if the community supports discussions to aid in this process. It 
is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and maintain the integrity of our 
university. 
Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve 
society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and 
expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society.
Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve 
society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and 
expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the 
changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to 
create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching 
and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and 
problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and 
commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the 
exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish. 
In any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each student 
to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is dishonest and is 
the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to disciplinary action. 
 
The university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations of 
academic integrity.  Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for Graduate 
Students describes procedures for disciplinary actions against graduate students in cases of 
alleged violations of academic regulations and the appeal process.   
Important note:  The LTI implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a disciplinary 
hearing according to the procedures of the department/program”.  Our procedure is as follows: 
a first violation is grounds for dismissal from the graduate program.  If we decide to not 
immediately dismiss, the first violation will result in the student being on disciplinary 
probation.  If a student commits a second violation while on probation, the penalty is 
dismissal from the graduate program. 
6 Academic Policies

Question: What kind of coursework is included in the dual-degree program?
Context: Academic Program Name:
Dual-Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (Portugal Partnership)

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/phd-programs/dual-degree-phd-lti.html

Overview:
The LTI offers a dual-degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies in cooperation with:
Universidade de Aveiro (Ph.D. in Computer Engineering), Universidade do Minho (Ph.D. in Informatics)  and the Universidade do Porto (FCUP, Ph.D. in Computer Science and FEUP, Ph.D. in Computer Science) as part of MAPi;
Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências – FCUL (Ph.D. in Informatics) 
Universidade de Lisboa, Instituto Superior Técnico – IST  (Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ph.D. in Information Security)
Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia – FCTUNL (Ph.D. in Computer Science)
Universidade de Coimbra, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia – FCTUC (Ph.D. in Information Science and Technology)
Students jointly enrolled in the LTI Ph.D program spend a year in Portugal, then two years at Carnegie Mellon taking classes in linguistics, computer science, statistical learning and task orientation.
After completing the majority of their academic requirements, students return to Portugal for the next two years to conduct extensive research, ultimately leading to a dissertation topic that will be publicly defended. One adviser from each institution co-supervises their student’s progress and helps to define their final thesis topic.

Requirements:
Students participating in the dual-degree program will spend their first year in Portugal, followed by two years in Pittsburgh to complete their coursework. They will complete a maximum of eight courses with a proper balance of focus areas (linguistics, computer science, statistical/learning and task orientation). After that, they will return to Portugal for their last two years, pursuing research and completing their dissertation. For more, see the Carnegie Mellon | Portugal page.

Curriculum:
While in the dual Ph.D. program, your schedule may look like this.
This includes a summer internship. 
4.1.2 Double-Dipping 
A Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at 
Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those 
same courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science 
without prior approval. 
4.1.3 Pass/Fail and Audit Grades 
Pass/fail and audit grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree 
requirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate 
courses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail 
or audit option for these courses. 
 
 
27
4.1.4 Transfer Credit 
An equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another 
institution, may be permitted to satisfy one of the MCDS course requirements, with 
permission from the Director. Students must petition for transfer credit by providing 
the Program Director with the prior course syllabus and other details that may be 
required by the Director in order to make a decision. See the section on “Definition of 
transfer credit versus course exemption”. NOTE: In all cases, credit may only be 
transferred from another degree program for courses deemed “free electives” - i.e., 
courses which were not used to satisfy a core requirement or total units requirement in 
a prior degree program. 
 
All MS students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU. 
4.1.5 External Internships and Job Interviewing 
MCDS students are expected to attain an external internship during the summer. 
International students must coordinate carefully with the University, due to visa 
restrictions. International students are required to consult with the Office of 
International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an 
offer contract. 
 
We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) implications 
with internships, and to review any IP agreements with their academic advisor before 
signing them. It is possible to lose ownership of your own inventions if they occur during 
an external internship. 
 
While it is necessary for students to travel off-campus for job interviews, it is not 
acceptable for a student to miss a course requirement or a capstone project commitment 
due to interview travel.

Do students receive guidance throughout the program?,"['handbook-msaii-2022-2023.txt', 'mcds-student-handbook-2023_2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: Do students receive guidance throughout the program?
Context: Occasionally, students are 
accepted into a different degree program at CMU and transfer to that program.  International 
students who do this should check with OIE to ensure that their visa is not jeopardized. 
10.2.4 Intellectual Property Policy 
See http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html. 
10.2.5 Teaching Requirements 
None.  Students who wish to do so may apply for teaching assistant positions for courses in 
which they have excelled.  It is important to ensure that the student’s academic responsibilities 
are not adversely impacted by a TAship, and vice-versa. 
10.3 Advising   
10.3.1 Student Advising  
Every MSAII student will be assigned an advisor, normally the Program Director.  Before the 
course registration period each semester, students must meet with their advisor to discuss their 
course selection. New students will be given instructions to register for their classes during the 
summer prior to entrance.    
10.3.2 Monitoring Progress  
The advisor meets with the student at least twice a year, providing guidance and monitoring the 
student’s overall progress.   
10.3.3 Degree Certification  
Students who graduate having met all the requirements for the degree will receive a diploma 
stating that they have received a “Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation.” 
18 
 
10.4 Internship   
Students must obtain an internship during the summer between the first and second years of the 
program.  This is a requirement.  An internship will provide students with the opportunity to 
apply the knowledge and technical skills learned during the first year of the program, to gain 
insight into AI and future market needs to further their experience and develop a strong context 
for the second-year concentration coursework.  Normally the internship will be with an outside 
company.  In some circumstances, a student who is doing research with a CMU faculty member 
during the summer may request that such research qualify as an internship. 
The internship must involve at least two months of full-time work and must relate to computer 
software development and is preferably AI-related. 
Students are encouraged to intern with an organization that corresponds to their individual area 
of interest and career goals.   
All students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI 
Practicum).  This course can be taken once during the program with Pass/Fail and will be 
counted toward graduation units.
Infractions 
 
After each academic progress review, each student will receive a letter indicating the 
result of the review and their standing in the program. If applicable, the letter will also 
note the following infractions by the student in the given semester: 
 Cumulative QPA is below 3.0, resulting in the student being put on Academic 
Probation (see below) 
 Cumulative QPA is below 2.6, resulting in academic probation or possible 
dismissal (see below) 
 Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee 
(see 3.7.2) 
 
Minimum QPA and Academic Probation 
 
Students must maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing with the 
program. Should a student’s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, 
he/she will be placed on academic probation for the following semester. In probation 
cases, the student will be required to 
 
enroll in courses as advised by the academic advisor,  
 
improve his/her grades to no less than an overall 3.0 QPA in the following 
semester, and  
 
meet any other goal set by the advisor during that period (e.g., fulfilling a core 
course requirement).  
If a student’s cumulative QPA drops below 2.6, the student will be considered at risk of 
being unable to complete the program and will be considered for dismissal. He/she will 
be required to meet the program director to discuss his/her situation. Only if, after that 
meeting, the MCDS program committee ascertains that the student is likely to complete 
 
 
20
the remaining program requirements in the allotted time, the student will be allowed to 
continue his/her studies in MCDS, and dismissed otherwise. If the student is allowed to 
continue their studies, they will be placed on academic probation for the following 
semester and is subject to the requirements above.

3.5 University Policies on Grades and Grading 
3.6.1 University Policy on Grades 
This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking 
courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, 
drop/withdrawals and course repeats. It also defines the undergraduate and graduate 
grading standards.
Students with prior professional experience may petition the MIIS 
Program Director to waive this requirement.  
MIIS students that do an internship during the summer semester are required to present 
their internship at a poster session at the beginning of the following Fall semester.  The 
poster and the student’s participation in the poster session are part of the internship 
requirement.  Participation is required unless waived in writing by the MIIS Program 
Director. 
3. Capstone requirements: Students must complete a capstone project (36 units) and a 
capstone planning seminar (6 units). The capstone requirement gives students 
experience with collaborative, team-oriented software development; significant hands-
on experience with the techniques studied in the classroom; and an opportunity to work 
on a large software application.  
a. The capstone project (36 units) is a large, group-oriented demonstration of 
student skill in one or more areas covered by the degree. Typically, the result of 
the capstone project is a major software application. The capstone project is 
supervised by a member of the faculty who meets with students on a weekly 
basis to monitor progress and provide guidance. 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 17 
 
b. The capstone planning seminar (6 units) organizes students into groups; defines 
capstone project goals, requirements, success metrics, and deliverables; and 
identifies and acquires data, software, and other resources required for successful 
completion of the project. The planning seminar must be completed in the 
semester prior to taking the capstone project. 
4.6 Registration Process/Procedures 
Students are responsible for registering for their courses. Use the Stellic Degree Audit 
Application to monitor your progress and plan your degree. Students can search for relevant 
courses in a number of ways and share your plan with your advisor directly through the 
application.

Are there any language proficiency requirements for international students?,"['handbook_phd_2023-2024.txt', 'mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: Are there any language proficiency requirements for international students?
Context: 3.1.3 Proficiency Requirements 
The LTI Ph.D. does not require any Qualifying Exams. Instead, a LTI Ph.D. student is required to 
demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas. 
 Writing: This is satisfied by producing a peer-reviewed conference paper, or the 
equivalent (a written report that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of conference-
paper quality). 
 
 Presentation: This is satisfied by the oral presentation of a conference paper, or the 
equivalent (an oral presentation that at least two SCS faculty certify as being of 
conference-talk quality). 
 
 Programming: This is satisfied by demonstrating competence in computer programming 
of language technology; this is normally satisfied in the course of the student's research 
and/or project work. 
 
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 16 
 
 Teaching: This is satisfied by two (2) successful Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships), as 
determined by the faculty member for whom the student serves as TA. Typically, one of 
these will be for an undergraduate class, and one for a graduate-level class. One of the two 
TA-ships may be in some form of pre-approved ""alternate service"", such as an SCS v-unit.  
 
The Program Coordinator must be notified in advance of a TA-ship, or it may not be accepted.  
Graduate students are required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct 
in Pennsylvania, as required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this 
Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English 
fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full university 
policy can be reviewed at:  
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html 
The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student 
Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.  
In addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (a mandatory 
screening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student Academic 
Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers develop fluency 
and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon.
The Student Academic Success Center is also charged with certifying the language of 
International Teaching Assistants (ITAs), ensuring that nonnative English speakers have the 
language proficiency needed to succeed as teaching assistants in the Carnegie Mellon 
classroom. Students preparing to do an ITA Certification should plan to take classes offered by 
the language support team at the SASC from the beginning of their first semester. Start by 
contacting the language support team at the SASC website or attend a Language Support 
Orientation at the SASC or in your department.

Question: Will students receive support finding housing in Portugal?
Context: The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery. A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists.

Research
My research focuses on better understanding the social and pragmatic nature of conversation, and using this understanding to build computational systems that improve the efficacy of conversation both between people, and between people and computers. In order to pursue these goals, I invoke approaches from computational discourse analysis and text mining, conversational agents, and computer-supported collaborative learning. I ground my research in the fields of language technologies and human-computer interaction, and am fortunate to work closely with students and post-docs from the LTI and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, as well as to direct my own lab, TELEDIA. My group’s highly interdisciplinary work, published in 160 peer-reviewed publications, is represented in the top venues in five fields: language technologies, learning sciences, cognitive science, educational technology and human-computer interaction.

An exciting direction of my group's work is spearheading a satellite working group to support social interaction for learning in MOOCs with EdX called DANCE. My research toward this end has birthed and substantially contributed to the growth of two thriving interrelated research areas: automated analysis of collaborative learning processes and dynamic support for collaborative learning. Both areas use intelligent conversational agents to support collaborative learning in a context-sensitive way.

All of my work draws insight from rich theoretical models from sociolinguistics and discourse analysis, and pares them down to precise operationalizations that capture the most important essence for achieving impact. I always start by investigating how conversation works and formalizing this understanding in models that are precise enough to be reproducible and that demonstrate explanatory power in connection with outcomes with real-world value. The next step is to adapt, extend and apply machine learning and text mining technologies that leverage this deep understanding to build computational models capable of automatically applying these constructs to naturally occurring language interactions. Finally, with the technology to automatically monitor naturalistic language communication in place, we can build interventions with real-world benefits.

Academic Program Name:
Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/miis.html

Overview:
The Master's in Intelligent Information Systems degree focuses on recognizing and extracting meaning from text, spoken language and video. As an MIIS student, you’ll receive the department’s deepest exposure to content analysis and machine learning. In addition to completing the program’s coursework, you’ll work on directed study projects with your faculty advisor for two semesters; participate in a summer internship; and collaborate with your peers on a semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. This combination of classroom instruction, professional experience, and using new skills in significant projects with world-class colleagues will help prepare you for a successful career in industry or government. Our alumni have gone on to exciting careers at places like Apple, IBM and Google, and most have job offers within six weeks of graduation.

Requirements:
The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.
MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:
Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.
Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.
MIIS: Advanced Study track offers an in-depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:
Human Language for Language Technologies
Language Technology Application
Machine Learning for Language Technologies
Part-time education option is available in some cases.

Academic Program Name:
Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/miis.html

Overview:
The Master's in Intelligent Information Systems degree focuses on recognizing and extracting meaning from text, spoken language and video. As an MIIS student, you’ll receive the department’s deepest exposure to content analysis and machine learning. In addition to completing the program’s coursework, you’ll work on directed study projects with your faculty advisor for two semesters; participate in a summer internship; and collaborate with your peers on a semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. This combination of classroom instruction, professional experience, and using new skills in significant projects with world-class colleagues will help prepare you for a successful career in industry or government. Our alumni have gone on to exciting careers at places like Apple, IBM and Google, and most have job offers within six weeks of graduation.

Requirements:
The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.
MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:
Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.
Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.
MIIS: Advanced Study track offers an in-depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:
Human Language for Language Technologies
Language Technology Application
Machine Learning for Language Technologies
Part-time education option is available in some cases.
MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements.

 Introduction 
Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, a graduate department in the School of 
Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses 
on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few 
years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI 
will also be rewarding professionally and personally. 
Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work-life balance helps to keep it 
in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor 
heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source for quality packaged foods, 
an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a 
city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has 
reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people 
work hard and make things that change the world. It is also an informal city, where people dont 
take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, 
competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the 
summer, with skiing and magnificent state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding 
if you make time for exploring the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania 
have to offer. 
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in 
philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a 
handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and 
ensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the 
policies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies. 
All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science 
(SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and 
policies, please see the universitys handbook The Word, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral 
Affairs web page, the Office of the Dean of Students web page, and other resources contained in 
Appendix A of this handbook.

 Introduction 
Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, a graduate department in the School of 
Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses 
on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few 
years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI 
will also be rewarding professionally and personally. 
Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work-life balance helps to keep it 
in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor 
heritage. In the past, it was the heart of the U.S. steel industry, a source for quality packaged foods, 
an important financial hub, and an early pioneer in railroads, radio, and nuclear power. This is a 
city where people worked hard and made things that changed the world. Today, Pittsburgh has 
reinvented itself as a leader in Computer Science and medicine, but it is still a place where people 
work hard and make things that change the world. It is also an informal city, where people dont 
take themselves too seriously and remember to have fun. It is home to excellent museums, 
competitive professional sports teams, inexpensive magic shows, and free music during the 
summer, with skiing and magnificent state parks nearby. Your stay here will be more rewarding 
if you make time for exploring the many activities that Pittsburgh and Southwest Pennsylvania 
have to offer. 
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in 
philosophical approach, procedures, policies, and regulations. Each department issues a 
handbook that informs graduate students of their program requirements and procedures and 
ensures that students have written access to standard information. This handbook describes the 
policies, procedures, and requirements for the Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies. 
All policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of Computer Science 
(SCS) policies and university policies. For information about Carnegie Mellon requirements and 
policies, please see the universitys handbook The Word, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral 
Affairs web page, the Office of the Dean of Students web page, and other resources contained in

Context: Academic Program Name:
Language Technologies Concentration

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/lt-concentration.html

Overview:
Human language technologies have become an increasingly central component of computer science. Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.

Requirements:
Students interested in the language technologies minor must complete our prerequisite courses with an average grade of B (3.0) or better before applying to the program. (Students who do not meet this average must submit a letter of explanation along with their application.) Prerequisites include:
Principles of Imperative Computation (15-122)
Principles of Functional Programming (15-150)
We also strongly encourage candidates to take:
Differential and Integral Calculus (21-120) and Integration and Approximation (21-122)
Matrices and Linear Transformations (21-241) or Matrix Theory (21-242)
Probability and Computing (15-259) or Probability (21-325) or Probability Theory for Computer Scientists (36-218) or Introduction to Probability Theory (36-225)

Curriculum:
The Language Technologies Concentration requires that SCS students complete one core course and their choice of three elective courses of at least 9 units each. The electives can be chosen from a specific set of stand-alone courses. In addition to the four courses, students are required to do an undergraduate research project for at least 9 units to complete their concentration.

 Introduction 
Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, a graduate department in the School of 
Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. You have joined a Ph.D. program that focuses 
on excellence, creativity, and training the next generation of research leaders. While the next few 
years will be a time of hard work and intense concentration, we hope that your time at the LTI 
will also be rewarding professionally and personally. 
Obtaining a Ph.D. is a long and often intense journey. A healthy work-life balance helps to keep it 
in perspective. Carnegie Mellon is located in Pittsburgh, a city with a rich industrial and labor

Question: What are some examples of language technologies mentioned in the Overview?
Context: Lori Levin
Research Professor, Language Technologies Institute
Research Area
Corpus Annotation and Resources, Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics
Research
There are more than 6,000 human languages, but less than a hundred of them have robust language technologies such as search engines, spell checkers or speech recognition. Nevertheless, speakers of the technologically poor languages may have uses for language technologies to access information related to education, politics, business, weather and health conditions — not to mention preservation of culture and community relationships. My work focuses on the linguistic aspects of language technologies, specifically the following: 

Language Technologies With Low Resources
Many languages lack sufficient data for supervised or unsupervised machine learning. There may also be low-resource scenarios for technology-rich languages like English in specialized styles or subject areas.  Such cases may call for hybrids of human-engineered knowledge and machine learning. The human engineered knowledge can be in the form of handwritten rules, priors or feature engineering.  

Language Universals and Typology
When there is insufficient time or data to build an NLP system, it is useful to fall back on what is known about human languages in general or what is known about related languages. The field of linguistic typology and universals provides expectations for what languages might be like. We are exploring how to use typology and universals to develop language technologies for new languages on short timelines or in low-resource scenarios. 

Corpus Annotation and Linguistic Resources
When time and data are available, language technologies can be based on supervised learning from annotated data. The annotations may be for any level of linguistic knowledge from sounds to social hierarchies. My approach to annotation is based on the linguistic theory of construction grammar.

Question: Apart from the prerequisite courses, what additional courses are encouraged for candidates?
Context: Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.
Students who plan to select the Systems concentration may wish to enroll in 15-513 “Introduction to Computing Systems” during the summer session preceding their enrollment in the program; this course is a prerequisite for many advanced Systems courses, so it should be completed during Summer if you wish to enroll in advanced Systems courses in the Fall.
Click here to see the MCDS Course Map.
Some example courses of study are included below.
Example 1: Analytics Major, 16 Months
Example 2: Systems Major, 16 Months
Example 3: Human-Centered Data Science Major, 16 Months
Depending on the concentration, additional learning outcomes are emphasized: 
 
Analytics. Students electing to complete the Analytics concentration will also learn to:  
 
 
Design, implement and evaluate a software system and machine-learning model 
on real world datasets at real world scale.  
 
Analyze and document data science requirements in different application 
domains and survey as well as critique state of the art solutions for those 
requirements. 
 
Systems. Students electing to complete the Systems concentration will also learn to:  
 
 
 
17
 
Implement and evaluate complex, scalable data science systems, with emphasis 
on providing experimental evidence for design decisions. 
 
Anticipate and avert structural and/or implementation problems with systems 
design, especially with scaling and tail distributions. 
 
HCDS. Students electing to complete the Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS) 
concentration will also learn to:  
 
 
Design, implement and evaluate a user experience prototype to allow for clear 
understanding of data science solutions. 
 
Apply social and behavioral research methods to data science problems to 
understand the human aspects of data collection and analysis. 
 
 
Throughout their coursework, students will take introductory courses on all those topics, 
practice them in advanced courses and seminars and demonstrate all learned skills in 
their Capstone project and internship. Students are encouraged to choose elective 
courses in the curriculum according to their professional goals and mastery of the main 
subjects.  
 
3.3.10 Capstone project 
The capstone project consists of students working in a team or individually on a project. 
The capstone project integrates the educational experience of the student. A capstone 
project is typically a CMU research project, or an industry sponsored project; 
occasionally students define capstone topics through communication with the faculty. 
Students interested in defining their own capstone topics should discuss with the MCDS 
faculty as early as possible. The capstone project is a great opportunity for a student (or 
student team) to “show off” their unique skills and accomplishments. Capstone projects 
have been instrumental in the hiring decisions for several employers. 
 
 
3.3.11 Elective courses 
Electives can be any graduate level course (numbered 600 or above) in the School of 
Computer Science. Students use their elective courses to enhance study in an area of 
interest or to explore new areas of interest.

requirement and an elective course requirement. 
3. Breadth requirements: Students must demonstrate breadth by passing one course in 
each of the following areas. In addition, MIIS-21 students must take two more LTI 
courses (24 units total) in one of the following areas of concentration: 
• Human language; 
• Machine learning; and 
• Language technology applications. 
 
The department maintains and publishes a list of courses that satisfy each of these 
requirements (Sections 3.2.5 – 3.2.7). Some courses used to satisfy a breadth requirement 
can also satisfy qualifying course requirements. A student should get approval from the 
director for the breadth courses, if not listed below. 
4.4 Approved Qualifying Courses 
Any graduate course (600-level or higher) offered by the Language Technologies Institute is 
a qualifying course. 
Any two graduate courses (600-level or higher) offered by departments within the SCS 
relevant to the MIIS degree other than LTI (Machine Learning or Computer Science 
departments, etc.) may be counted as approved qualifying courses.

https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/lt-concentration.html

Overview:
Human language technologies have become an increasingly central component of computer science. Information retrieval, machine translation and speech technology are used daily by the general public, while text mining, natural language processing and language-based tutoring are common within more specialized professional or educational environments. The LTI prepares students for this world by offering a minor that gives you the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.

Requirements:
Students interested in the language technologies minor must complete our prerequisite courses with an average grade of B (3.0) or better before applying to the program. (Students who do not meet this average must submit a letter of explanation along with their application.) Prerequisites include:
Principles of Imperative Computation (15-122)
Principles of Functional Programming (15-150)
We also strongly encourage candidates to take:
Differential and Integral Calculus (21-120) and Integration and Approximation (21-122)
Matrices and Linear Transformations (21-241) or Matrix Theory (21-242)
Probability and Computing (15-259) or Probability (21-325) or Probability Theory for Computer Scientists (36-218) or Introduction to Probability Theory (36-225)

Curriculum:
The Language Technologies Concentration requires that SCS students complete one core course and their choice of three elective courses of at least 9 units each. The electives can be chosen from a specific set of stand-alone courses. In addition to the four courses, students are required to do an undergraduate research project for at least 9 units to complete their concentration.
Course Requirements for Undergraduate Minor
MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements. MIIS-21 students have to take at least two more courses from the selected concentration area to satisfy their degree requirements, making it total of 108 units (typically 9 courses) of qualifying and elective courses, that also satisfy breadth requirements.

Course Requirements for Undergraduate Minor
The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor. 
Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or 
Statistics courses.  
Students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular 
attention to the following issues. 
 Recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the SCS course requirement. 
Please see the Program Director for approval of an elective as an SCS course.  
 Students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., 
summer courses).  
 The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; 
however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (B is the 
minimum for Ph.D.).  
3.6 
Completing an M.S. Degree Enroute to a Ph.D. 
Courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for 
one M.S. degree. The most common choice is the LTIs Master of Language Technologies (MLT) 
degree because its requirements are similar (but not identical) to the Ph.D. requirements. Other 
M.S. degrees within the LTI and outside of the LTI are also possible.  
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook

grading standards. 
Process for Appealing Final Grades  
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the 
instructor and the department, unit, or program.  
Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed 
without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade.

1 Welcome 
Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, Master of 
Computational Data Science Program. While this handbook is specific to 
your academic experience in the department, there are several other 
resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during 
their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, 
the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, the 
Office of the Dean of Students, and others are included in Appendix A of 
this handbook. 
1.1 The MCDS Degree 
The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) 
degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language 
Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer 
Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students 
with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with 
advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to 
students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, 
programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in 
Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the 
program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and 
students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for 
further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an 
additional fourth semester. 
 
The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; 
students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first 
semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration 
(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in 
consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad 
guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given 
concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program 
is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a 
required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical 
training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the 
LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in 
 
 
7
corporate research and development laboratories. 
 
The program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and 
no Master’s Thesis is required.
Answer: "
Are there any specific sets of stand-alone courses that students can choose as electives?,"['mcds-student-handbook-2023_2024.txt', 'handbook_phd_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: Are there any specific sets of stand-alone courses that students can choose as electives?
Context: 3.3.11 Elective courses 
Electives can be any graduate level course (numbered 600 or above) in the School of 
Computer Science. Students use their elective courses to enhance study in an area of 
interest or to explore new areas of interest. 
3.3.12 Undergraduate courses 
Undergraduate courses are taken to address an area of weakness in the student’s prior 
preparation. Undergraduate courses (numbered less than or equal to 599) may be taken 
pass/fail or for credit but do not count toward the 144 units of eligible study: The course 
and course grade will appear on the student’s transcript, and the course grade will factor 
as part of the student’s QPA. 
 
 
18
3.3.13 Independent study course 
Independent study courses allow students to cover study of a particular area of interest, 
and are used when no formal course is available in a given subject area. Students who are 
interested in continuing to a Ph.D. degree often enroll in Independent Study, since it 
offers the opportunity to perform research directly with a faculty member. Independent 
study courses are considered electives. 
 
Each independent study course must be advised and approved by at least one faculty 
member. Agreement to supervise an independent study course is purely voluntary on the 
part of the faculty member. It is the duty of the student, therefore, to negotiate the terms 
and conditions of the independent study with the pertinent faculty members of CMU who 
will be supervising the study. These individuals are referred to as “independent study 
supervisors.” Once the student finds someone who agrees to supervise such a course, 
he/she must: 
 
 
1. Students wishing to take an independent study must request approval from their 
academic advisor and complete proposal before the first day of classes in a given 
semester: 
2. Enter into an agreement with the independent study supervisor that includes 
course expectations, including deliverables. 
3. Secure the “Independent Study Contract Form” from the MCDS administrator. 
4. Complete the form, provide a brief description of the work to be done, including 
deliverables and how they will be graded. 
5. Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the 
MCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the 
Director.
The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor. 
Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or 
Statistics courses.  
Students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular 
attention to the following issues. 
 Recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the SCS course requirement. 
Please see the Program Director for approval of an elective as an SCS course.  
 Students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., 
summer courses).  
 The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; 
however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (B is the 
minimum for Ph.D.).  
3.6 
Completing an M.S. Degree Enroute to a Ph.D. 
Courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for 
one M.S. degree. The most common choice is the LTIs Master of Language Technologies (MLT)

Question: What are the two timing options for earning the MCDS degree?
Context: Academic Program Name:
Master of Computational Data Science

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mcds.html

Overview:
The MCDS degree focuses on engineering and deploying large-scale information systems. Our comprehensive curriculum equips you with the skills and knowledge to develop the layers of technology involved in the next generation of massive information system deployments and analyze the data these systems generate. When you graduate, you’ll have a unified vision of these systems from your core courses; internship experience; and semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. MCDS graduates are sought-after software engineers, data scientists and project managers at leading information technology, software services and social media companies.

Requirements:
The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
Here are the options:
Standard Timing — a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 48 units. This timing is typical for most students. Students graduate in December.
Extended Timing — a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 36 units. Students graduate in May.
For a complete overview of the MCDS requirements read the MCDS Handbook.

Curriculum:
To earn an MCDS degree, students must pass courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, a concentration area, and electives. Students must also complete a capstone project in which they work on a research project at CMU or on an industry-sponsored project.
In total, students must complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses, and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog.
Any 
additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered 
electives. 
 
To maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 
course units per semester. A student may not take more than 60 units per 
semester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must 
maintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester. 
3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course 
All MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data 
Science course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a 
grade of “B” or better.  
3.3.5 Plan of study 
The degree consists of two timing options based on the length of time the student spends 
working on the degree. The student chooses their timing at the start of the degree 
program (for visa requirements). Changes in timing are possible with the approval of the 
Director of the degree program and successful visa extension application with CMU’s 
Office of International Education. Note that all degree options consist of the same amount 
of coursework: 
 
 
 
Professional Preparation Track – a 16-month degree consisting of study for Fall 
and Spring semesters, a summer internship, and Fall semester of study. Each 
semester consists of a minimum of 48 units of study. This timing is typical for most 
students. The student graduates in December. 
 
Research Preparation Track – a 20-month degree consisting of study for Fall and 
Spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of Fall and Spring 
study. Each semester consists of a minimum of 36 units of study. This timing is 
designed for students interested in extending their time at CMU for developing 
applied research skills in preparation for further graduate study or research-
oriented employment. Note that the per-semester course load is lower, but the 
total cost is higher since four semesters of tuition are paid. This timing is also 
 
 
15
recommended for students interested in pursuing a PhD after graduation. The 
student graduates in May.

Students who plan to select the Systems concentration may wish to enroll in 15-513 “Introduction to Computing Systems” during the summer session preceding their enrollment in the program; this course is a prerequisite for many advanced Systems courses, so it should be completed during Summer if you wish to enroll in advanced Systems courses in the Fall.
Click here to see the MCDS Course Map.
Some example courses of study are included below.
Example 1: Analytics Major, 16 Months
Example 2: Systems Major, 16 Months
Example 3: Human-Centered Data Science Major, 16 Months
5. Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the 
MCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the 
Director. 
 
Independent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first 
week of classes in a given semester. 
3.3.14 Double counting courses 
No course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course 
satisfy requirements in two degree programs. 
3.3.15 Courses outside of the School of Computer Science 
Elective courses in other Schools at Carnegie Mellon may be taken with prior permission 
of the Director. 
3.3.16 Grades 
All courses offered by the SCS CMU are graded on the 4.3 grading standard  
http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html. MCDS students must maintain a 
3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B- 
or better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student 
 
 
19
receives a C- or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree 
requirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not 
count towards the MCDS degree. 
 
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of 
enrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can 
be requested online through The HUB at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-
records/verifications/ 
3.3.17 Student Review, Academic Probation and Academic Actions 
The MCDS program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each 
semester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding 
the fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity. Should 
a student’s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to 
meet standards and policies established by Carnegie Mellon University, the student may 
be dismissed from the program. 
 
Infractions 
 
After each academic progress review, each student will receive a letter indicating the 
result of the review and their standing in the program.

Overview:
The MCDS degree focuses on engineering and deploying large-scale information systems. Our comprehensive curriculum equips you with the skills and knowledge to develop the layers of technology involved in the next generation of massive information system deployments and analyze the data these systems generate. When you graduate, you’ll have a unified vision of these systems from your core courses; internship experience; and semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. MCDS graduates are sought-after software engineers, data scientists and project managers at leading information technology, software services and social media companies.

Requirements:
The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
Here are the options:
Standard Timing — a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 48 units. This timing is typical for most students. Students graduate in December.
Extended Timing — a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study. Each semester comprises a minimum of 36 units. Students graduate in May.
For a complete overview of the MCDS requirements read the MCDS Handbook.

Curriculum:
To earn an MCDS degree, students must pass courses in the core curriculum, the MCDS seminar, a concentration area, and electives. Students must also complete a capstone project in which they work on a research project at CMU or on an industry-sponsored project.
In total, students must complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses, and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog.

Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, Master of 
Computational Data Science Program. While this handbook is specific to 
your academic experience in the department, there are several other 
resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during 
their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word,

1.1 The MCDS Degree 
The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) 
degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language 
Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer 
Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students 
with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with 
advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to 
students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, 
programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in 
Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the 
program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and 
students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for 
further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an 
additional fourth semester. 
 
The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; 
students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first 
semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration 
(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in 
consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad 
guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given 
concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program 
is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a 
required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical 
training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the 
LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in 
 
 
7
corporate research and development laboratories. 
 
The program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and 
no Master’s Thesis is required.

What is the duration of the MLT program and when does the program usually start and end?,"['mlt-student-handbook-2023-2024.txt', 'program_info_MasterofLanguageTechnologies.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: What is the duration of the MLT program and when does the program usually start and end?
Context: 5.1.4 Independent Study 
For an Independent Study to satisfy an MLT students coursework requirements, it must be 
approved by the MLT Program Director in advance.  In consultation with the CMU faculty 
member who will be supervising the Independent Study, the student should produce a short 
(half-page to one page) description of the goals of the Independent Study, and how the results 
will be evaluated, and submit it to the Program Director before the end of the Add period of the 
semester of the proposed study. The study should be planned so that it is finished in time for 
the supervising faculty member to give a grade at the end of the semester.  Independent 
studies may be undertaken for 6 or 12 units. Normally only one Independent Study would be 
approved during a students MLT coursework. 
5.1.5 Transfer Credit 
An equivalent graduate course previously completed at another institution may be permitted to 
satisfy one of the MLT course requirements. The decision on whether a course may be 
transferred is made by the MLT Program Director. Typically, the student will provide the 
Program Director with the syllabus of the external course, and the Program Director will use 
that and the students transcript to make the decision.  
See the section on Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption. 
All MLT students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU.  
5.1.6 External Internships 
MLT students may only engage in internships if their advisors recommend it, since the program 
is 24 months, including summers. International students are required to consult with the Office 
of International Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an offer 
contract. 
We caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) problems with 
internships, and to review any IP agreements with their advisors before signing them. It is 
possible to lose ownership of your ideas. 
Important: See also section 4.2.3, External Employment/Consulting.

5.1.7 Transferring Into the MLT Program 
Transfers into the MLT program are not permitted during a students first semester at CMU. 
Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this is a university 
policy.
Academic Program Name:
Master of Language Technologies

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mlt.html

Overview:
The MLT program prepares students for a research career in academia or industry. In this program, you’ll be immersed in research for two full years. During the academic year, your time will be evenly split between taking courses and doing research with your faculty advisor. Your summer will be devoted entirely to research. Many MLT grads continue on to Ph.D. programs at CMU and other top institutions, while others pursue careers at companies emphasizing research and rapid innovation.

Requirements:
The MLT program lasts two years (24 months), and students must complete two summers of research. Students should usually expect to graduate in August of their second year.
MLT students take 120 or more course units (about 10 courses), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. Most of these are 12-unit courses, although lab courses are typically 6 units. Our courses generally assume knowledge of programming and data structures. The remaining units may also be taken from the LTI, or with approval from the faculty advisor, any other senior- or graduate-level course offered at CMU or Pitt.
Directed research is another integral part of the MLT program; MLT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors.
Students may also choose to complete an optional MLT thesis. Guidelines can be found in the MLT Handbook.

4.4 Definitions of LTI Terminology 
We define here some of the terms as used in this handbook: 
 An LTI course is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with an 
11-XXX counts as 1/2 of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, ""course"" means an 
actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that 
we will allow any one MLD (10-xxx) graduate-level course to count as an LTI course. 
 An SCS course is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the 
School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts 
as 1/2 of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, ""course"" means an actual classroom 
course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note: Recommended 
electives that are technically outside of the SCS now count towards this requirement; for 
example, Digital Signal Processing in ECE. Please see the Program Director for approval 
of electives as SCS. 
 LTI Focus Areas are sets of courses defined on the LTI course webpage under Course 
Categories. If a student believes a new course should be added to a Focus Area, they 
should notify the Chair of the LTI Graduate Programs. He will decide, with advice from 
faculty in the appropriate area, whether it should be in the Focus Area, and if approved 
it will be added to the LTI Focus Area webpage. 
o A Task-Orientation Focus Course is simply a course belonging to that LTI Focus 
Area, as listed on the Course Categories webpage. 
 An LTI lab course is simply a course in the list of lab courses defined in the LTI Course 
Categories webpage. 
4.5 Recommended Electives outside of SCS  
Students are free to take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross-
registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of 
their program as described above.

Directed research is another integral part of the MLT program; MLT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors.
Students may also choose to complete an optional MLT thesis. Guidelines can be found in the MLT Handbook.

Curriculum:
Here's an example of how your two years in the MLT program may break down.
Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them; this is a university 
policy. 
Students may request to transfer into the MLT program after completing their first semester. 
The student must make the request in writing (or email) to the MLT/PhD Admissions Chair. The 
MLT/PhD Admissions Chair will inform the student about what application materials are 
required; for example, an explanation of why a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a 
proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts. Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree 
program are not required to retake GRE and TOEFL exams or to produce new transcripts from 
other universities. The MLT program will conduct an expedited admissions process after 
receiving such a request.   
5.1.8 Transferring Out of the MLT Program 
The MLT program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree program. 
Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into the program are 
permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MLT degree program should 
consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired degree program to learn whether 
transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to request such a transfer. 
5.1.9 Drop/Add/Withdraw Procedures 
Students taking undergraduate and Masters level courses must follow the procedures and 
deadlines for adding, dropping, and withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic 
calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-
changes.index. Please note that there is a separate calendar for doctoral courses that does not 
apply to Masters students. 
5.1.10  Statute of Limitations 
As outlined in the Masters Students Statute of Limitations, 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- 
limitations.html. Students will complete all requirements for the masters degree within a 
maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a masters student, or less if required by 
a more restrictive department, school, or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has 
lapsed, the person may resume work towards a masters degree only if newly admitted to a 
currently offered masters degree program under criteria determined by that program. 
See also the Duration of Study policy.

Question: What choices do students have apart from LTI courses, and are there restrictions on selecting courses outside of CMU or Pitt?
Context: 4.5 Recommended Electives outside of SCS  
Students are free to take elective courses outside the SCS, at Carnegie Mellon or cross-
registered at the University of Pittsburgh, as long as the student fulfills the requirements of 
their program as described above. The student should discuss any such electives in advance 
with their advisor; typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics 
courses, or Statistics courses. 
Note: recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the SCS course requirement. 
Please see the Program Director for approval of electives as SCS. 
Note also that students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal 
tuition (e.g., summer courses). The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the 
department offering the course; however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described 
above still applies (B- is the minimum for PhD, C for MLT). 
 
MLT Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 18 
 
4.6 LTI Orientation 
At the beginning of each Fall semester, the LTI provides a set of lectures and talks to help 
students learn about the work done by CMU faculty and to provide an opportunity for advisors 
to recruit new students.  Students are expected to attend them and treat them seriously, 
because they provide a good introduction to the broad range of research done at the LTI. 
Students do not register for the LTI Orientation, nor do they receive a grade; however, the 
department is serious about its expectation that new students will attend these talks. 
For many years, these talks were called ""the Immigration Course (IC)"", which caused confusion.  
The older name has been retired; however, people who have been at CMU a long time may 
occasionally use the older name.   
4.7 End of Semester Evaluation 
Near the end of the spring and fall semesters, the student must prepare a statement that 
describes their achievements in the current semester, and plans for the next semester. At the 
end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. The student's 
advisor serves as the student's advocate in this process. The result of the evaluation is a letter 
from the faculty to the student that indicates whether the student is making satisfactory 
progress towards completing the degree. 
A good letter typically indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress.
The student should discuss any such electives in advance with their advisor. 
Typical choices might include ECE courses for Speech students, Pitt Linguistics courses, or 
Statistics courses.  
Students interested in taking recommended electives outside the SCS should pay particular 
attention to the following issues. 
 Recommended electives outside of the SCS count towards the SCS course requirement. 
Please see the Program Director for approval of an elective as an SCS course.  
 Students need advance approval for any courses not covered by their normal tuition (e.g., 
summer courses).  
 The grading of outside courses is the responsibility of the department offering the course; 
however, the LTI's Minimum Course Grade Policy described above still applies (B is the 
minimum for Ph.D.).  
3.6 
Completing an M.S. Degree Enroute to a Ph.D. 
Courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for 
one M.S. degree. The most common choice is the LTIs Master of Language Technologies (MLT) 
degree because its requirements are similar (but not identical) to the Ph.D. requirements. Other 
M.S. degrees within the LTI and outside of the LTI are also possible.  
LTI Ph.D. Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 20 
 
Students interested in an M.S. degree other than the MLT degree should discuss their plans with 
their Ph.D. advisor due to the additional courses and project work that may be involved. 
3.7 
Grading and Evaluation 
3.7.1 University Policy on Grades 
Carnegie Mellons Grading policy offers details concerning university grading principles for 
students taking courses and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading 
options, drop/withdrawals, and course repeats.  It also defines the undergraduate and graduate 
grading standards. 
Process for Appealing Final Grades  
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the 
instructor and the department, unit, or program.  
Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed 
without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade.

Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: Why is directed research significant in the MLT program, and what assistance do students receive throughout this stage?
Context: It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in 
their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time. 
4.3 Optional Masters Thesis 
MLT students may optionally elect to complete a Masters Thesis; it is not required. Students 
who intend to apply for the PhD program should consider the MLT Thesis as one of several 
ways to demonstrate their research potential. Other possibilities include innovative research in 
a research project or class project work. 
The MLT Thesis must be completed according to the following guidelines. Note in particular the 
October 31 proposal deadline! 
 There are two course components required for students who elect to complete the M.S. 
Thesis: 11-928  Masters Thesis I (with the chosen thesis advisor, typically for 12 units, 
typically in the Fall of their second year) and 11-929  Masters Thesis II in the following 
Spring. 
 Each of these two courses counts towards 6 units of MLT-level LTI course credit; if the 
student goes on to an LTI PhD, the second course (11-929) counts towards one PhD lab 
requirement.   
 The MLT thesis may focus on either a significant research result or a significant 
implementation of a new technology. The student should work with their advisor to 
define an interesting but bounded thesis research project. The MLT thesis culminates in 
MLT Graduate Student Handbook 
Page 16 
 
a publication-quality paper that clearly describes the work in terms of its research 
significance. 
 The MLT thesis committee will be composed of a thesis advisor and two additional 
readers, to be chosen by the student in consultation with the advisor, during the Fall 
Masters Thesis I course. At least 2 of the 3 committee members must be SCS faculty 
working in Language Technologies. 
 To receive a final grade for the first semester's course, the student must have prepared 
a written proposal of at least five pages, describing the scientific thesis to be 
investigated, any relevant research already completed by the student, a comparison 
with related work by others, and a detailed description of the work to be done in the 
next semester. The proposal MUST be accepted by the committee by the end of 
October, or the student will not be allowed to enroll in 11-929  Masters Thesis II!

The proposal MUST be accepted by the committee by the end of 
October, or the student will not be allowed to enroll in 11-929  Masters Thesis II! 
 Sometime during the semester when the student enrolls in 11-929  Masters Thesis II 
(typically, their final semester), the student will distribute a draft of the thesis to the 
committee for initial review. This should be done as early as feasible, to avoid last-
minute surprises that could delay final approval of the thesis. 
 The thesis work culminates in submission of the final version of the thesis document, 
followed by a public presentation of the work in an LTI seminar (or other suitable public 
forum). Since the defense is public, the LTI graduate program administrator must 
receive all the information required for a public announcement at least one week before 
the defense. The Masters Thesis presentation is somewhat less rigorous than a PhD 
thesis defense. The presentation must communicate the research work done, similar to 
a conference paper presentation. The committee will observe the presentation, and 
then decide whether the thesis and presentation were acceptable, or whether further 
work is required. Unlike a PhD defense, only a simple majority vote of the committee is 
required for approval. 
 Although students are required to enroll in the appropriate course sequence of two 
Masters Thesis courses, it is not required that students finish the thesis by the end of 
that second semester. If a student requires more time to revise the thesis to the 
committee's satisfaction, and adequately present the work, an incomplete grade will be 
assessed in the Masters Thesis course, until such time as the work and presentation are 
accepted. The student will still be allowed to walk in Spring Commencement, if all other 
requirements for the MLT degree have been completed. Students should note that any 
financial support beyond the end of the semester will be on a case-by-case basis, and 
must be arranged in advance with the project supporting them. Students are strongly 
encouraged to finish the thesis work within one (1) year following the semester they 
enroll for the first Masters Thesis course.

1 Welcome 
Welcome to the Language Technologies Institute, Master of 
Computational Data Science Program. While this handbook is specific to 
your academic experience in the department, there are several other 
resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during 
their tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, 
the student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, the 
Office of the Dean of Students, and others are included in Appendix A of 
this handbook. 
1.1 The MCDS Degree 
The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) 
degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language 
Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer 
Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students 
with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with 
advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to 
students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, 
programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in 
Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the 
program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and 
students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for 
further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an 
additional fourth semester. 
 
The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; 
students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first 
semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration 
(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in 
consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad 
guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given 
concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program 
is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a 
required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical 
training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the 
LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in 
 
 
7
corporate research and development laboratories. 
 
The program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and 
no Master’s Thesis is required.
Academic Program Name:
Master of Language Technologies

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mlt.html

Overview:
The MLT program prepares students for a research career in academia or industry. In this program, you’ll be immersed in research for two full years. During the academic year, your time will be evenly split between taking courses and doing research with your faculty advisor. Your summer will be devoted entirely to research. Many MLT grads continue on to Ph.D. programs at CMU and other top institutions, while others pursue careers at companies emphasizing research and rapid innovation.

Requirements:
The MLT program lasts two years (24 months), and students must complete two summers of research. Students should usually expect to graduate in August of their second year.
MLT students take 120 or more course units (about 10 courses), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. Most of these are 12-unit courses, although lab courses are typically 6 units. Our courses generally assume knowledge of programming and data structures. The remaining units may also be taken from the LTI, or with approval from the faculty advisor, any other senior- or graduate-level course offered at CMU or Pitt.
Directed research is another integral part of the MLT program; MLT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors.
Students may also choose to complete an optional MLT thesis. Guidelines can be found in the MLT Handbook.

Curriculum:
Here's an example of how your two years in the MLT program may break down.

The purpose of the Core Curriculum is to prepare you to discover new AI applicants and develop them into a product suitable for further development, often leading to a startup enterprise.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the curriculum.
Preparation Prerequisite
Historically, students typically need a refresher on basic computer science systems before beginning graduate work at CMU.
MSAII students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree 
requirements are expected to remain in close contact with the program, and will be certified at 
the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Students must 
refer to the CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations 
(https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-
limitations.html) regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the 
maximum length of time allowable for master’s degree completion and certification. 
11.1.11 Additional Guidance for Students   
Program of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree 
requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.  
Financial aid and student account. Students are expected to make normal progress toward 
their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. 
Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent 
upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their 
current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they 
may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their 
current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.)  
Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and 
financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated 
undergraduate and master’s degree programs.  
International students. Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is 
tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 
27 
 
students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-
than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification 
(integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the 
Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations. 
11.1.12 Withdrawal   
Students who need to withdraw from the program (leave the university with no intention of 
returning) for personal, medical or academic reasons must contact the MSAII Director to 
discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form. For more information refer to 
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html.

Question: What does the Core Curriculum cover in the MSAII program?
Context: Academic Program Name:
Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/msaii.html

Overview:
The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) program is a successor to the M.S. in Biotechnology, Innovation and Computing (MSBIC). It combines a rigorous AI and machine learning curriculum with real-world team experience in identifying an AI market niche and developing a responsive product in cooperation with external stakeholders. The core program, which lasts four semesters and leads to a capstone project, focuses on both intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship, equipping graduates to either begin a startup or develop a new organization within an existing company. Students will also gain critical practical skills, such as making persuasive technical presentations, assembling development teams, and evaluating the potential of new market ideas.

Requirements:
Incoming students generally hold undergraduate degrees in computer science, software engineering, bioinformatics or bioengineering. To earn the MSAII degree, you must pass courses in the Core Curriculum, the Knowledge Requirements and Electives. You must also complete a capstone project in which you work on a development project as part of the Core Curriculum. In total, you will complete 192 eligible units of study, including 84 units of Core Curriculum (including the 36-unit Capstone), 72 units of Knowledge Requirements and at least 36 units of approved Electives.
For full requirements and program details, read the MSAII Handbook.

Curriculum:
To earn the MSAII degree, you must pass courses in the Core Curriculum, the Knowledge Requirements and Electives. You must also complete a capstone project in which you work on a development project as part of the Core Curriculum. In total, you will complete 195 eligible units of study, including 84 units of Core Curriculum (including the 36-unit Capstone), 72 units of Knowledge Requirements, at least 36 units of approved Electives and the LTI Practicum (3 units, associated with your summer internship).  The purpose of the Core Curriculum is to prepare you to discover new AI applicants and develop them into a product suitable for further development, often leading to a startup enterprise.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the curriculum.
Preparation Prerequisite
Historically, students typically need a refresher on basic computer science systems before beginning graduate work at CMU.
This includes any 
AIV letter received in during the summer preceding matriculation. 
A student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances: 
a) A student who has received two Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will be 
terminated.  There are no exceptions and the Program Director has no discretion over 
such a termination as it is an LTI policy. 
b) A student who has received one Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may be 
terminated by the Program Director if the violation is so serious that the student cannot 
be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program. 
c) A student has received three warning letters of any type from the MSAII program. 
d) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is 
provided. 
An AIV letter or violation of University Policy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal 
procedures.  See Section 4.5.2, below.  However, a decision to terminate a student after appeal 
because of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable. 
10.2 Course Requirements  
14 
 
1) Summer Before Entrance  
Admitted students are required to take, pay for, and pass 15-513 Introduction to 
Computer Systems OR 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science during the 
summer prior to their arrival at Carnegie Mellon.  The units earned in these courses are 
not counted toward the total number of units required for graduation.  These courses 
may be taken pass/no pass, but cannot be dropped.  A student who drops either course 
during the summer will not be permitted to begin the degree program in the fall, but 
must retake one of the courses the following summer.  The MSAII course offerings are 
available at msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum.  The university’s complete Schedule of 
Classes can be found at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search.

Question: What are the Elective options for the MSAII program?
Context: See also the ‘Duration of Study’ policy. 
11.7 Residency Requirement 
The MSAII is a full-time, in-residence program conducted only on the Pittsburgh campus.  In 
exceptional circumstances, such as visa complications or medical exigencies, permission may be 
granted by the Director allowing a student to participate in short portions of the program 
remotely.  This is not possible for first-year students. 
12 Financial Issues 
12.1 Graduate Student Funding  
34 
 
The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs.  
Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and support from other sources.  The HUB website 
(https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html) provides the Graduate Financial 
Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other 
helpful links.  Additional information on financial issues for graduate students can be found on 
the web at www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/. 
Students in the professional MS programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching 
Assistants and Research Assistants.  However, typically full-time MS students do not have time 
for these activities.  Typically Research Assistantships are most likely to be awarded to students 
in Carnegie Mellon’s research-oriented degree programs. 
12.2 University Financial Aid 
Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The 
HUB website: www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html.  Students will find the 
Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial 
aid and other helpful links. 
12.3 Health Insurance  
Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking 
students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by 
the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is “enrolled as the 
dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance 
plan” (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-health-insurance.html).  
It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to 
either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over the 
course of the academic year.
First Fall semester.   Only open to MSAII.  
 
17-762 – Law of Computer Technology (12 units). First Fall semester 
 
11-695 – AI Engineering (12 units). First Spring semester

Answer: "
Do students need to complete an internship in the MSAII program?,"['handbook-msaii-2022-2023.txt', 'handbook-msaii-2022-2023.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: Do students need to complete an internship in the MSAII program?
Context: All students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI 
Practicum).  This course can be taken once during the program with Pass/Fail and will be 
counted toward graduation units.  International students must apply for Curricular Practical 
Training (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE).  To 
obtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling out employment dates, work hours, and wages 
or stipend.  It is the student’s responsibility in 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester 
following the internship to all current MSAII students detailing the student’s internship 
experience. 
International students who are interested in working in the U.S after graduation are required to 
consult with the Office of International Education (OIE) which oversees the OPT registration.  
Note: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon. 
NOTE: Students are personally responsible for securing a suitable internship.  The Career and 
Professional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and 
internship opportunity listings in Handshake.  We strongly suggest students begin the 
internship search beginning in the Fall of your first year. Some internship opportunities have 
application deadlines in the Fall, so by starting your search early, you won't miss out on these 
internships.  The Career and Professional Development Center will assist students with the 
internship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is the 
students’ responsibility.   
The following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome.  Many of the 
events below have been modified due to COVID. 
September/October  
 Meet with your advisor to discuss your interests and plan your internship search.  
19 
 
 Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally 
with second-year students who can offer first-hand information about their internships.  
 Attend the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure 
to potential employers for internships.   
November/December  
 Begin researching organizations and internship opportunities. Pay close attention to 
organizations that have established internship programs and their deadlines.  
 Attend workshops to perfect your resume, hone your interviewing skills, and gain 
knowledge about the internship search process.
November/December  
 Begin researching organizations and internship opportunities. Pay close attention to 
organizations that have established internship programs and their deadlines.  
 Attend workshops to perfect your resume, hone your interviewing skills, and gain 
knowledge about the internship search process.  
January/February  
 At this point, you should have a “short list” of organizations at which you would like to 
intern. This list can include organizations that have established internship programs as 
well as those that interest you without formal internship programs. 
 Update your resume with relevant academic projects, coursework, etc. 
 Begin utilizing your network for internship leads as well as checking organization’s 
websites for internships.  
 Make contact with employers, sending resumes and applications, and initiating internship 
interviews in person or by phone.  
 Attend Network Nights and talk to alumni about internship opportunities in their 
organization. They are an excellent resource for learning more about a particular 
organization, career field or employment opportunity. You can find alumni in the Alumni 
Directory, Alumni Career Advisor Network, and Carnegie Mellon Alumni LinkedIn 
Network.  
March/April  
 At this point, you should have secured an internship or be interviewing with various 
organizations.  
 Prepare a backup plan if your first choices of internships do not work out. 
 Attend relevant Network Nights and Career Fairs at Carnegie Mellon.  
 If you are an F-1 Visa student, you must apply for CPT.  
 MSAII students should enroll in 11-935 for three units. You will not have to pay tuition for 
this course.   
10.5 Employment Eligibility Verification  
If you are receiving compensation or a stipend from CMU, if you are going to be a TA or you are 
planning to seek a position with CMU, then Employment Eligibility Verification is required.  
Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of 
compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below.

Can students take any course for elective credit in the MSAII program?,"['handbook-msaii-2022-2023.txt', 'program_info_MasterofScienceinArtificialIntelligenceandInnovation.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: Can students take any course for elective credit in the MSAII program?
Context: degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. 
11.1.5 Pass/No Pass Courses (Pass/Fail) 
With the approval of the Program Director, a graduate student may choose to take one 
ELECTIVE course pass/no pass. Core courses and Knowledge courses may not be taken pass/no 
pass.  By the deadline for changing a course to pass/no pass, the student must fill out the 
Pass/No Pass Approval Form and receive permission from their advisor. A pass/no pass election 
is irrevocable as a matter of CMU policy. (A form can be found at 
https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html) 
11.1.6 Auditing a Course  
With the approval of the Program Director, a graduate student may audit a course by obtaining 
the permission of the instructor or teaching department and completing the Course Audit 
Approval Form. Audited classes are not taken for credit and cannot be used to fulfill graduation 
requirements. (Audit form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html)  
11.1.7 Adding a Course  
During the ADD period of each semester (the first two weeks of the semester), students may add 
a course by registering online. After the ADD deadline, they may add a course by completing the 
Late Add Request form and obtaining the permission of both: 1) the instructor or teaching 
department and 2) their advisor. (Add form can be found at 
https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html)   
11.1.8 Dropping a Course  
Dropping courses is not recommended except for reasons of health or family emergency.  Many 
SCS courses have long waitlists, and dropping a course means that some other student who 
might have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability.  Also, if students 
in the MSAII program drop courses, then the instructors of those courses may no longer allow 
MSAIIs to enroll. 
Sometimes, however, a student’s workload can become unexpectedly heavy because of course 
requirements.  No one is expected to suffer from such pressure and dropping a course may 
become a necessity.  To avoid this unfortunate circumstance, you should inform yourself in 
advance of the curriculum and workload in each course you plan to take and ensure that you are 
capable of handling the load.
Knowledge Requirements (72 units)
This is a set of six rigorous courses to ensure that you are able to develop advanced AI applications.

Question: Are there any preparatory classes for the MSAII program?
Context: Academic Program Name:
Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/msaii.html

Overview:
The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) program is a successor to the M.S. in Biotechnology, Innovation and Computing (MSBIC). It combines a rigorous AI and machine learning curriculum with real-world team experience in identifying an AI market niche and developing a responsive product in cooperation with external stakeholders. The core program, which lasts four semesters and leads to a capstone project, focuses on both intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship, equipping graduates to either begin a startup or develop a new organization within an existing company. Students will also gain critical practical skills, such as making persuasive technical presentations, assembling development teams, and evaluating the potential of new market ideas.

Requirements:
Incoming students generally hold undergraduate degrees in computer science, software engineering, bioinformatics or bioengineering. To earn the MSAII degree, you must pass courses in the Core Curriculum, the Knowledge Requirements and Electives. You must also complete a capstone project in which you work on a development project as part of the Core Curriculum. In total, you will complete 192 eligible units of study, including 84 units of Core Curriculum (including the 36-unit Capstone), 72 units of Knowledge Requirements and at least 36 units of approved Electives.
For full requirements and program details, read the MSAII Handbook.

Curriculum:
To earn the MSAII degree, you must pass courses in the Core Curriculum, the Knowledge Requirements and Electives. You must also complete a capstone project in which you work on a development project as part of the Core Curriculum. In total, you will complete 195 eligible units of study, including 84 units of Core Curriculum (including the 36-unit Capstone), 72 units of Knowledge Requirements, at least 36 units of approved Electives and the LTI Practicum (3 units, associated with your summer internship).  The purpose of the Core Curriculum is to prepare you to discover new AI applicants and develop them into a product suitable for further development, often leading to a startup enterprise.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the curriculum.
Preparation Prerequisite
Historically, students typically need a refresher on basic computer science systems before beginning graduate work at CMU.
Such 
courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: 
Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only 
if their college’s and department's policies allow this.)  
The MSAII program does not accept transfer credit for courses taken prior to matriculation at 
Carnegie Mellon. 
The MSAII program does not accept distance education credits except for distance courses 
offered by Carnegie Mellon or PCHE institutions. 
10.10 Academic Integrity 
Carnegie Mellon’s Academic Integrity policy is posted at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. All students 
22 
 
are expected to be familiar with this policy, including the university-wide protocol for handling 
academic integrity violations.  The policy includes the University expectations around academic 
integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.  
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures 
(https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html) is also 
recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and 
adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also 
outline the appeal process. 
It is an absolute requirement that the work you submit must be your own, unless you 
specifically identify the source of any material that is not yours.  This includes quotations and 
material from websites.  In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any 
person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that work.  Any student who violates 
the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in 
suspension or expulsion under University policies.  THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE 
FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE 
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.   
You are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them 
as your own work.  Any copied material MUST appear in quotation marks or italics and MUST 
be accompanied by a citation to the original source.  Failure to do this violates CMU’s Policy on 
Academic Integrity, which states, “In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources 
is required.

Answer: "
How many examples of course schedules are provided for the MIIS-16 and MIIS-21?,"['program_info_MasterofScienceinIntelligentInformationSystems.txt', 'miis-handbook_2023-2024.txt']","You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question concisely in 1-10 words using the context.
Question: How many examples of course schedules are provided for the MIIS-16 and MIIS-21?
Context: MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements. MIIS-21 students have to take at least two more courses from the selected concentration area to satisfy their degree requirements, making it total of 108 units (typically 9 courses) of qualifying and elective courses, that also satisfy breadth requirements.
For a full list of requirements, read the MIIS Handbook.

Curriculum:
MIIS-16:-
Example Course of Study #1
This schedule would satisfy course requirements for a student interested in text mining, text analytics and question-answering systems.
Example Course of Study #2
This schedule would satisfy course requirements for a student interested in voice-based computer applications.
Example Course of Study #3
This example would satisfy course requirements for a student interested in text mining, text analytics and question-answering systems who has petitioned to have the summer internship waived.
MIIS-21:-
Example Course of Study #1
This schedule would satisfy course requirements for a student interested in deepening their expertise in Machine Learning area of concentration.
Example Course of Study #2
This schedule would satisfy course requirements for a student interested in deepening their expertise in Language Technology Applications area of concentration.
Example Course of Study #3
This example would satisfy course requirements for a student interested in deepening their expertise in Human Language area of concentration
For a complete breakdown of curriculum and requirements, read the MIIS Handbook.
Typically, the student will provide the Program Director with the syllabus of the 
external course, and the Program Director will use that and the student’s transcript to make 
the decision.  
Satisfying a breadth requirement with a course from another institution does not reduce the 
number of CMU course units that must be taken to attain the MIIS degree.  
See the section on “Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption” on page 25. 
6.1.6 Transferring into the MIIS Program 
Transfers into the MIIS program are not permitted during a student’s first semester at CMU.  
Students must begin their study at CMU in the program that admitted them. 
Students may request to transfer into the MIIS program after completing their first semester 
and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester.  The student must make the request 
in writing (or email) to the MIIS Program Director.  The MIIS Program Director will inform 
the student about what application materials are required, for example, an explanation of why 
a transfer is desired, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts.  
Students that are already enrolled in an LTI degree program are not required to retake GRE 
and TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo exams or to produce new transcripts from other universities.   
The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a 
request.  The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the 
transfer will allow the student to be “on schedule” by the end of the spring semester, so that 
the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall 
semester. 
MIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS-16 to MIIS-21 and vice versa) after 
beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed within the 
first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than 
once! Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration 
records of international students. Students also must understand that extension of their stay 
in the program will lead to additional financial obligations.  
U.S. citizens, virtually, have no restrictions on how many times they can switch if it is done for 
a legitimate reason.

Part-time education option is available in some cases.
MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the curriculum.
Preparation Prerequisite
Historically, students typically need a refresher on basic computer science systems before beginning graduate work at CMU. You must pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before your program commences. (This course is the distance education version of 15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems.) Failure to pass the course means that you have to take 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester, and the units will not count toward your 192 eligible units of study.
Curriculum Components
Each major has different core curriculum requirements.
Core Curriculum (84 units)
This is a five-course sequence based on the four main phases of innovation development, including opportunity identification, opportunity development, business planning and incubation of a business with a viable product. The courses must be taken in the order listed:
11-651, Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (12 units).  First fall semester.  In this course, students are divided into teams to survey the fieild of AI applications, make presentations to the faculty and fellow students on areas that are ripe for AI development, and must develop a product proposal, which will be carried through for the next three semesters, leading to 11-699, the Capstone Project.
17-762, Law of Computer Technology (12 units).  First fall semester.  A review of legal principles applicable to computer developments, including AI law and formation of startups.
11-695, AI Engineering (12 units).  First spring semester.  This course is devoted to building deep learning applications using TensorFlow and Python.

Overview:
The Master's in Intelligent Information Systems degree focuses on recognizing and extracting meaning from text, spoken language and video. As an MIIS student, you’ll receive the department’s deepest exposure to content analysis and machine learning. In addition to completing the program’s coursework, you’ll work on directed study projects with your faculty advisor for two semesters; participate in a summer internship; and collaborate with your peers on a semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. This combination of classroom instruction, professional experience, and using new skills in significant projects with world-class colleagues will help prepare you for a successful career in industry or government. Our alumni have gone on to exciting careers at places like Apple, IBM and Google, and most have job offers within six weeks of graduation.

Requirements:
The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.
MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:
Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.
Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.

Question: What are the courses in Summer for the fifth MS in Intelligent Information Systems layout?
Context: Academic Program Name:
Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems

Website:
https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/miis.html

Overview:
The Master's in Intelligent Information Systems degree focuses on recognizing and extracting meaning from text, spoken language and video. As an MIIS student, you’ll receive the department’s deepest exposure to content analysis and machine learning. In addition to completing the program’s coursework, you’ll work on directed study projects with your faculty advisor for two semesters; participate in a summer internship; and collaborate with your peers on a semester-long, group-oriented capstone project. This combination of classroom instruction, professional experience, and using new skills in significant projects with world-class colleagues will help prepare you for a successful career in industry or government. Our alumni have gone on to exciting careers at places like Apple, IBM and Google, and most have job offers within six weeks of graduation.

Requirements:
The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor.
MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:
Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.
Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.
MIIS: Advanced Study track offers an in-depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:
Human Language for Language Technologies
Language Technology Application
Machine Learning for Language Technologies
Part-time education option is available in some cases.
MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements.
Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.
Students who plan to select the Systems concentration may wish to enroll in 15-513 “Introduction to Computing Systems” during the summer session preceding their enrollment in the program; this course is a prerequisite for many advanced Systems courses, so it should be completed during Summer if you wish to enroll in advanced Systems courses in the Fall.

Some example courses of study are included below.
Example 1: Analytics Major, 16 Months
Example 2: Systems Major, 16 Months
Example 3: Human-Centered Data Science Major, 16 Months

MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:
Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.
Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.
MIIS: Advanced Study track offers an in-depth degree in one of the following areas of concentration:
Human Language for Language Technologies
Language Technology Application
Machine Learning for Language Technologies
Part-time education option is available in some cases.
MIIS-16 students must take at least 84 units (typically 7 courses) of qualifying and elective courses that satisfy human language, machine learning, and language technology applications breadth requirements.
Knowledge Requirements (72 units)
This is a set of six rigorous courses to ensure that you are able to develop advanced AI applications.

Unless approved by the Program Director in advance, the course requirements must be satisfied 
by actual classroom courses, not credit given for research or independent study. 
An LTI course is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX 
counts as one-half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, ""course"" means an actual 
classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. Note that the LTI allows 
any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an ""LTI course"".
