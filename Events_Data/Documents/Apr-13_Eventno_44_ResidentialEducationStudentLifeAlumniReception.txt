Event Details: 
On behalf of the Residential Education and the Office of Orientation and Family Programs (formerly the Student Life Office), we invite you to join us for a Carnival reception. We will have light refreshments and current Office of Residential Education and First Year Orientation staff will be present, including Housefellows.  We would love to reminisce with you about being a CA, RA, HOC, OL or OC and how these roles on campus might have impacted you. And, as always, we are excited to share with you the exciting changes and happenings in Residential education at Carnegie Mellon. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Kristine Kengor at kkengor@andrew.cmu.edu or call 412-268-2142.
