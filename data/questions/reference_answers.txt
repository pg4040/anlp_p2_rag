"To obtain a Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies, you need to pass 96 units (eight courses) of graduate courses consisting of at least 72 units of LTI courses (one class per focus area) and at least 24 units of SCS courses. Two lab courses in separate research areas are also mandatory."
"Here's a sample five-year schedule for a Ph.D. candidate: 
Year 1: Fall – Grammars and Lexicons, Algorithms for NLP, Directed Study, Search Engines or Machine Learning for Text Mining, Machine Translation, Directed Study, Required Research;
Year 2: Fall – Software Engineering for LT (I), Speech Understanding, Self-Paced Lab, Directed Study, Software Engineering for LT (II), Self-Paced Lab, Directed Study, Required Research;
Year 3: Directed Research, Directed Research, Directed Research;
Year 4: Directed Research, Directed Research, Directed Research;
Year 5: Directed Research, Directed Research, Directed Research."
