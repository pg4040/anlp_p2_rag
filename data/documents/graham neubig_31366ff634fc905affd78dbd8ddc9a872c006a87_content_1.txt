achieves a distinguishability score of 120,000 by simple exponentiation of CodeBERTScoreâ€™s output score. To illustrate this, we conducted a distinguishability evaluation with the same configurations as before, but with a variant of CodeBERTScore that we call CodeBERTScorek, and defined as the composition of CodeBERTScore with the f (x) = xk function, that is: CodeBERTScorek (y1, y2) = (CodeBERTScore (y1, y2)) k. As Figure 8 shows, distinguishability of CodeBERTScorek increases almost exponentially while increasing k, although the base CodeBERTScore metric has not changed. We thus argue that distinguishability is not a reliable meta-metric and is no substitute for execution-based- or human-rating. We further suspect that any meta-metric that compares exact, absolute, scores across different metrics is susceptible to such manipulations, and the reliable way to compare metrics is according to the way they rank different examples, rather than the exact scores. The distinguishability results of CodeBERTScorek with different values of k are shown in Figure 8. As Figure 8 shows, the distinguishability increases almost exponentially with the increasing value of k. We thus argue that distinguishability is not a reliable metametric and is no substitute for execution-basedor human-rating. We further suspect that any meta-metric that compares exact, absolute, scores across different metrics is susceptible to such manipulations, and the reliable way to compare metrics is according to the way they rank different examples, rather than the exact scores.
