recipientsâ€™ degree of satisfaction may not correlate directly with the amount of sensory function they have in the UE transplant. Stakeholders described how acquiring even minimal amounts of protective sensation was experienced as a benefit over prosthetic devices.

Satisfaction with Sensation focuses more on satisfaction and mental/emotional implications of regaining sensory functioning and can be depicted in an item such as: My hand(s) help(s) me feel closer with people when I touch them.
