(f) If there were to be a paradigm shift in the next few years, in what direction should it go? (g) Do you think changes in the research community have changed your teaching? (Prompts: how?

If you’d prefer not to answer any of them, just let me know. (a) With which gender do you identify? i. Man ii. Woman iii. Or, feel free to specify as you wish (b) I am going to read some age brackets. Can you indicate when I read a bracket that your age falls into? i. 18-24 ii. 25-34 iii. 35-44 iv. 45-54 v. 55-64 vi. 65+ (c) Which country were you born in?

(f) Do you consider yourself a part of a minoritized group in your field? (g) Anything else in your background that feels relevant or that you want to add? 3.
