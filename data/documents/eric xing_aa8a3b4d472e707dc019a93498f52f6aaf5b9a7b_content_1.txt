Title: Applicability of the 0–1 test for chaos in magnetized Kerr–Newman spacetimes
Authors: Daqi Yang, Xin Wu
Section: 6 Summary
effects of the black hole charge on the regular and chaotic dynamics are dependent on the sign of the particle charge. The variation of the black hole charge does not very sensitively affect the dynamics of neutral particles. With the black hole charge increasing, the motions of positively charged particles are not easily chaotic, whereas those of negatively charged particles are. On the other hand, no universal rule can be given to the effect of a small change of the black hole magnetic charge on the dynamical transition from order to chaos.
