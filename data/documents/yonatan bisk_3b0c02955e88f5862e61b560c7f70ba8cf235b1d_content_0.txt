Section: H.4 Using The Stretch: Navigation vs. Position Mode
We leave API documentation to the HomeRobot code base, but want to note one other complexity when using the robot. Stretch’s manipulator arm is pointed to the right of its direction of motion, which means that it cannot both look where it is going and manipulate objects at once. This allows the robot to be lower cost and fit the human profile - more information on the robot’s design is available in other work [22]. However, it’s something important to consider when trying to control Stretch to perform various tasks. We use Stretch in one of two modes: • Navigation mode: the robot’s camera is facing forward; we use reactive low-level control for navigation; the robot can rotate in place, roll backward, and will reactively track goals sent from the desktop. • Manipulation mode: the robot’s camera is facing towards its arm; we do not use reactive low-level control for navigation and do not rotate the base. Instead, we treat the robot’s base as an extra, lateral degree of freedom for manipulation. This is especially relevant when grasping or placing; it means that, for our heuristic policies, the robot transitions into manipulation mode after moving close enough to the goal, and may track slightly to the left or the right, in order to act as if it had a full 6dof manipulator. All in all, these changes make the low-cost robot more capable and easier to use for a variety of tasks [12, 24, 25].
