high-dimensional contexts, leads to conditions with as few as just one sample – too small to124 infer accurate context-specific models. Ignoring contextual effects (i.e. population modeling) is similarly ill-advised125 for heterogeneous data, leading to spurious results from models that are misspecified and inaccurate (e.g. Simpson’s126 paradox).127 Contextualization [39] addresses this by applying deep learning to the meta-relationship between contextual in-128 formation and context-specific model parameters. Contextualization unifies previous approaches such as varying-129 coefficient modeling [40], cluster analysis, and cohort analysis by introducing two simple concepts: a context en-130 coder which translates sample context into model parameters, and a sample-specific model which represents the latent131 context-specific mechanisms of data generation. By learning how models change in response to context, contextual-132 ization enables powerful control over high-dimensional and continuously varying contexts, discovering dynamic latent133 structure underlying data generation in heterogeneous populations.134 Contextualization Enables Estimation of Sample-Specific Correlation, Markov, and Neigh-135 borhood Networks136 To contextualize Markov, correlation, and neighborhood networks, we first unify them with linear parameterizations137 equivalent to each models’ unique constraints (See Methods). Linear parameterization provides a differentiable ob-138 jective for optimizing each model and the linear residual errors are proportional to the negative log likelihood of139 each network model under the data. Our unifying linearization of these models allows us to apply contextualization140 uniformly to each network class, and further enables us to benchmark and test the effects of common model personal-141 ization paradigms against contextualization in terms of model likelihood and modeling errors.142 4 Markov Neighborhood Correlation Population 0.985 ± 0.006 0.984 ± 0.004 0.963 ± 0.000 Cluster-specific 0.365 ± 0.014 0.349 ± 0.012 0.683 ± 0.052 Disease-specific 0.368 ± 0.003 0.351 ± 0.003 0.673 ± 0.002 Contextualized 0.322 ± 0.014 0.296 ± 0.013 0.529 ± 0.019 Contextualized Networks Improve Likelihood of Held-Out Expression Profiles143 Contextualization improves the fit of networks models to gene expression data (Table 1). We benchmark the contextu-144 alized networks by comparing against several granularities of partition-based models: (1) a population network model145 which estimates the same network for all samples, (2) cluster-specific networks that are estimated independently for146 each cluster of contextual information, and (3) disease-specific networks that are estimated independently for each147 cancer type (Fig. 7). For all three network models, we evaluate the fit of the network model to actual expression148 data by measuring the predictive performance of the network graphical model. These predictive performances are149 measured as mean-squared errors between predicted and observed expression data which are inversely proportional to150 the model likelihood under the probabilistic interpretation of the network graphical
