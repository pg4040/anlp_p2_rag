Section: 1 Introduction
AI documentation such as model cards (Mitchell et al., 2019); – We incorporate a new attribution tool into the VSCode demo that can help users detect and locate model generations that may have been copied from the training set. This is achieved through a two-step process that involves a lightweight membership check followed by a search over a BM25 index (Section 9); and – We have significantly improved the PII redaction pipeline by collecting a PII dataset containing 12,000 files with 22,950 annotated entities. We fine-tuned our own encoder model (StarEncoder) on this dataset, resulting in a robust PII detection model (Section 4).
