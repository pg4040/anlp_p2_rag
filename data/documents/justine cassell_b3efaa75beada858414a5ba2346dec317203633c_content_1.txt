Section: 5.3 In-depth analysis of the informative features
from tutor" is the only feature appearing as a predictor of Propositional hedges (n=20). This is consistent with the feature analysis in Table 5, suggesting that tutoring moves do not significantly improve the performance of the classifier; (v) Nonverbal behaviors do not appear as important features for the classification. This is coherent with results from (Goel et al., 2019). Note that prosody might play a role in detecting instructions that trail off, but, as described, paraverbal features were not available; (vi) Would plays an important role in the production of hedges, as it is strongly associated to Propositional hedges (n=2). It is interesting to note that, when designing the rule-based classifier, we saw it decrease in performance when we started to include would in our regular expression patterns, probably because the form is hard to disambiguate for a deterministic system. While exploring the Shapley values associated to each clause, we observed that features like tutoring moves are extremely informative for a very small number of clauses (therefore not significantly influencing the overall performance of the prediction), and more or less not informative for the rest. Inferring the global importance of a feature as a mean across the shapley values in the dataset may not be the only way to explore the behavior of gradi- ent boosting methods. It might be more useful to cluster clauses based on the importance that SHAP gives to that feature in its classification, as this could help discover sub-classes of hedges that are differentiated from the rest by their interaction with a specific feature (in the way that some Apologizers are characterized by an "oh"). We also note that the explanation model is sensitive to spurious correlations in the dataset, caused by the small representation of some class: for example, "nine" (n=7) and "four" (n=20) are positive predictors of Apologizers.
