Section: 
in the detector coordinates remains stable over a short period. The background can be accurately determined by convolving the total event rate with the normalized spatial distribution. However, due to changes in detector efficiency of EDs caused by temperature variations, which differ for different detectors, the spatial distribution undergoes slight changes over time during the data taking. We employed a sliding window method to obtain a smoothed spatial distribution to address this issue. Specifically, a time step of 1 hour was selected, and at each step, events that arrive within ±5 hours were used to calculate the spatial distribution. This long time window may result in spurious large-scale structures of the background, which need to be corrected during the analysis (see Sec. A of the Supplemental Material). To reduce the impacts of known sources to the background estimate, we mask out relevant sky regions when calculating the background. Detected sources by LHAASO-KM2A1 with a pre-trial significance of 5σ, and known sources from those compiled in TeVCat2 [40] were masked with mask radii Rmask = n · σ, where n is a constant factor, and σ =√ σ2psf + σ 2 ext is the combined Gaussian width of the point spread function (PSF) of KM2A σpsf and the source extension σext. Since the PSF varies with energy, we adopt the largest one in the energy bin of 10 − 15 TeV to get consistent ROIs for all energy bins. For a clean background sky region, n = 5 is adopted. To avoid repeated masking of the KM2A sources and TeVCat ones, whenever the TeVCat source is located within 2σ, where σ is the Gaussian source width of the KM2A source fitted with E > 25 TeV, they are regarded as the same source and the KM2A parameters are used. The Galactic plane with latitude |b| ≤ 10◦ for declination δ ≤ 50◦ and |b| ≤ 5◦ for δ > 50◦ was also masked. A smaller mask region for high declination regions is to ensure sufficient statistics left for an accurate background estimate. To measure the diffuse emission, the contribution from point-like and extended sources should be excluded. Similar with above, we mask both the sources detected by KM2A and those by other experiments as compiled in TeVCat, but with 1 The first LHAASO source catalog can be found in Ref. [39]. Here, we use each source’s fitting location, extension, and energy spectrum, assuming a two-dimensional Gaussian morphology and a power-law spectrum. 2 http://tevcat.uchicago.edu n = 2.5 to balance the source contamination
