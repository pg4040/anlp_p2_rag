N.N. interaction but also the N.N.N. interaction and uniaxial anisotropy, the energy dispersions in Figs. 3 and 6C are different. However, the nonreciprocal dispersions appear remarkably along the N-P-Ŵ line in both cases. The origin of the nonreciprocity can be understood as follows: When the magnetic moment at each Tb site located at the position r is spatially inverted by operating −r with each moment direction being kept (see Fig. 1A), the hedgehog state on the IC is transformed to the anti-hedgehog state. The anti-hedgehog state is defined as the state where the magnetic moment directions are all inverted from those shown in Fig. 1A. The same is applied to the 1/1 AC (see Fig. 1B). Since the magnetic state changes by the space inversion, the inversion symmetry is broken by the hedgehog ordering. Hence, the nonreciprocal dispersion is considered to appear in the excitation from the uniform hedgehog order in the 1/1 AC. As for the uniform hedgehog order in the QC, the nonreciprocal excitation was reported in Ref.18. Since the infinite limit of the unit cell size of a series of ACs (1/1, 2/1, 3/2, . . . ACs) corresponds to the QC, the infinite folding of the energy dispersion of magnon is expected to occur in the QC. This tendency was indeed confirmed by theoretical calculations in one-dimensional system39 and two-dimensional system40. This is considered to be reflected in the fine structures of the intensities in the dynamical structure factor for the wide q-ω plane in A 1.0 0.5 0.0 -0.5 -1.0 0.1- 5.0- 0.0 5.0 0.1 1.0 0.5 0.0 -0.5 -1.0 0.1- 5.0- 0.0 5.0 0.1 B-7.658 -8.400 -9.142 -9.883 -10.62 -11.37 -12.11 -12.85 -13.59 -14.33 -15.07 h k h l P P’ H H N NP C qy qx qz P N H P’ -10 0 10 20 ( ) q -q q Figure 6.

These results suggest that the hedgehog ordering which breaks the spatial inversion symmetry is the origin of the
