used and stored at room temperature. One pouch of each packaging was opened fortnightly for estimations. The storage quality evaluation was done on the basis of sensory evaluation, moisture content, reducing sugars, free fatty acids, peroxide value and total bacterial count. For sensory evaluation, chapatti was prepared. Two scales were used for organoleptic evaluation that is Nine Point Hedonic Scale and Score Card (Amerine et al., 1965). A Semi trained panel consisting of 30 members (Aggarwal and Premchand, 2008) from the Department of Foods and Nutrition did the sensory evaluation. Moisture was estimated by the procedure as used in proximate composition. Free fatty acid and peroxide value was determined by AOAC 2000 method. Nelson-Somogyi (Somogyi 1952) method was used to estimate reducing sugars. Total bacterial count was determined using standard plate count (SPC) technique (APHA, 1992).
