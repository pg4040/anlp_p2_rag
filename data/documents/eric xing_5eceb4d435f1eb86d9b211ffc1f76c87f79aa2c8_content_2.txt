sample efficiency and robustness against disturbances. In a practical robot arm control scenario, DPETS not only outperformed the modelfree RL approaches while reducing 99% usage of samples but also suppressed the related MBRL approaches with over 100% higher average return and more sophisticated trajectories in robot end-effector control. All these results indicated the potential of DPETS as an emerging direction of practical MBRL approaches. According to the properties summarized in Table I where ⃝, × and N/A denote the involved, uninvolved and inapplicable terms, the contributions of this work are: 1) A restrictive MC Dropout with enhanced stability and expressive capability was proposed by combining the 1Code available https://github.com/mrjun123/DPETS The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provided the background of existing probabilistic MBRL approaches based on neural networks. Section III detailed the proposed DPETS. It was evaluated and analyzed in Section IV as the experimental results. The conclusion was given in Sections V.
