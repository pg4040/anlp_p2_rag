and inference phases of this specific model version, the accessibility scores are uniformly set to 1 if the region is identified as a chromatin accessibility peak. This equates to assuming binary chromatin accessibility states within the studied scenario. Motif features To calculate the motif binding score within a specific genomic region, the corresponding sequence is scanned against the hg38 reference genome. This procedure involves utilizing 2,179 transcription factor motif position-weighted matrices (PWMs), as previously compiled by Jeff et al.4, accessible at Vierstra’s resources. For the scanning process, the MOODS tool is used with default threshold5. More specifically, to represent sequence information while mitigating feature redundancy, a specialized motif scoring process is implemented. Building on Jeff’s prior research, these 2,179 motifs are categorized into 282 motif clusters, a classification determined by PWM similarity. By using this established clustering definition, nucleotide-level motif matches that are redundant are eliminated, retaining only the match with the highest score within overlapping matches belonging to the same motif cluster. Subsequently, the scores of all non-overlapping motif matches within each motif cluster are summed, yielding one cumulative score for each of the 282 clusters. As a final step, motif binding scores for all regions within a given cell type are determined and subjected to min-max normalization across regions. This normalization facilitates model generalization and the training process, ensuring that each motif cluster’s score is processed in a standardized manner. Input data GET is designed to capture the interaction between different regions and regulators. To facilitate that, we need each input sample to contain a certain number of consecutive accesible regions, mimicking the "reception field" of an RNA Polymerase II. Through previous experiment we found that ideally the equivalent genome coverage should be around or more than 2 Mbp, a range where most of the chromatin contact happens. As a result, based on our current data prepossessing pipeline we choose to 1/8 use 200 as the input region numbers for one training sample. We acquired non-overlapping samples from the genome to use as our pretrain input, and from only the training chromosomes to use as our finetune input. GET model is engineered to encapsulate the interactions between neighboring regions. To achieve this, it is essential for each input sample to encompass a specific number of consecutive accessible regions, simulating the "reception field" of an RNA Polymerase II. Through empirical research, we determined that an optimal equivalent genome coverage for this purpose is approximately 2 Mbp or greater, a span within which the majority of chromatin contacts occur. Consequently,
