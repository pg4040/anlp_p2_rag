Section: A. The Temporal Acoustic Parameter Loss (TAPLoss)
To calculate the TAPLoss, we define the Temporal Acoustic Parameter Estimator Ay . Ay(t, p) represents the acoustic parameter p at a discrete time frame t. To predict Ay , we define the estimator: Ây = T AP(y) The T AP function takes in a signal input y. It calculates a complex spectrogram Y with F = 257 frequency bins. It then passes this complex spectrogram to a recurrent neural network to output the temporal acoustic parameter Ây . TAP loss is then defined as the mean average error between the actual and the predicted estimate. MAE(Ay, Ây) = 1 TP T−1∑ t=0 P−1∑ p=0 |Ay(t, p)−Aŷ(t, p)| ∈ R During training, T AP parameters learn to minimize the divergence of MAE(As, Âs) using Adam optimization. Since this loss is end-to-end differentiable and takes only waveform as input, it enables acoustic optimization of any speech model and task with clean references.
