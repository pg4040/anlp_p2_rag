Frontiers in Nutrition 08 frontiersin.org U.S., the present study predicted an improvement in HRQOL scores with increased physical activity. However, our control group showed no significant changes in all SF-36 items, as measured before and after the intervention. On the other hand, because middle-aged and older adults with no exercise habits were subjected to exercise, there was a possibility that mental and physical fatigue associated with the walking exercise might affect the SF-36 score. However, the control group in this study showed no significant changes in physical health, mental status, or items representing the frequency of feeling tired. It is possible that in addition to the increase in physical activity, the consumption of MCTs may have affected subjective health. In Japan it is recommended to exercise at least two days a week, for at least 30 min per session, to reduce the risk of age-related decline in functional capability in daily living, and to extend the period of independent living by increasing the intensity and frequency of physical activity (31). This is comparable to the exercise load in the present study, but no participants dropped out of the study because of the walking exercise intervention. Therefore, the results may be valuable in that continued MCTs intake, combined with relatively easy exercise, may have improved HRQOL in the subjects of this study. There were significant increases in the MCTs supplement groups, compared to the control, especially in the subscales of mental aspects of health, such as VT, MH and GH. Their summary score,
