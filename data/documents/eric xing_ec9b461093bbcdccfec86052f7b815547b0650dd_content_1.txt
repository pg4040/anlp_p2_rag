a cutoff powerlaw (CPL), as described in [2]. The fitted scattering angle distribution as well as the resulting PD and PA are shown in figure 2, while the obtained values for the polarization parameters are shown in the first P o S ( I C R C 2 0 2 3 ) 6 1 9 column of Table 1. Figure 2 also shows the light curves of all the detectors used for the analysis of GRB170114A as well as the time selections for the source and background. 20 0 20 40 60 Time (s) POLAR n1 n5 n8 b0 Source interval Background interval 10 20 30 40 degree 40 80 12 0 16 0 an gl e 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Scattering Angle 0 1 2 3 4 Ne t R at e (c nt /s /b in ) 16 0 24 0 32 0 40 0 48 0 eb re ak 20 40 60 80 de gh ig h 20 40 60 80 degree 40 80 12 0 16 0 an gl e 16 0 24 0 32 0 40 0 48 0 ebreak 20 40 60 80 deghigh 40 80 12 0 16 0 angle (a) 15 30 45 60 de gh ig h 10 20 30 40 degree 40 80 12 0 16 0 an gl e 15 30 45 60 deghigh 40 80 12 0 16 0 angle (b) Figure 3: Posterior distributions of polarization parameters for different energy resolved models: a) Heaviside fit on the polarization degree. The 3 polarization parameters are the PD at low and high energies and the energy break separating the two regions. This latter parameter is unconstrained while the polarization degrees at low and high energy are compatible to each other. b) Heaviside fit on the polarization degree with a fixed energy break at 150 keV. The 2 polarization parameters are the PD at low and high energies. No significant variation of the PD with energy is observed. The polarization degree has been fitted for GRB170114A using a Heaviside function, while keeping the PA constant with energy. Two trials have been made, one with a free energy break (position of the "step") and one by fixing the energy break to 150 keV. In the former case, the 4 polarization parameters are the PD at low and high energy, the PA, and the energy break position, P o S ( I C R C 2 0 2 3 ) 6 1 9 while in the latter case
