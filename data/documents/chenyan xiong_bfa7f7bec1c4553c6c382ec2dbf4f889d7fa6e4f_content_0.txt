Title: COMPLEQA: Benchmarking the Impacts of Knowledge Graph Completion Methods on Question Answering
Authors: Donghan Yu, Yu Gu, Chenyan Xiong, Yiming Yang
Section: C Filtering Incorrect Triplets
As additional experiments for Section 4.1, we present the question-answering performance of other KGC methods besides ComplEx after discarding incorrect triplets and retaining only the correct ones. As depicted in Figure 4, itâ€™s clear that QA efficacy significantly improves when incorrect triplets are excluded, notably when the knowledge graph is 80% incomplete, which reflects a situation where KGC quality is notably poor, with a high frequency of incorrect triplet predictions.
