to the dose optimization strategy of patients with renal failure, indicating that AUC0-24/MIC targets are more likely to be achieved by extending the dosing interval than by reducing the unit dose. Finally, based on the above simulation results, this study proposed a dose selection scheme of teicoplanin for septic patients with different renal functions taking into account both Cmin and AUC0-24/MIC targets. This study has several limitations. First, the analysis was based on data obtained from ICU septic patients, therefore, the conclusions may not necessarily apply to other patient populations. Besides, we adopted putative MIC values in the simulations since individual MIC values were not available. Finally, considering that the PTA and CFR results of the simulated dose schemes were not perfect, clinical studies are necessary to assess the safety and clinical utility of teicoplanin doses higher than currently recommended.
