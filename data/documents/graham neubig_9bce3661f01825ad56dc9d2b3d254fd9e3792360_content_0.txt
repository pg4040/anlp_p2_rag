Section: B Discussion Examples Created by Humans and Systems
Table 9 shows discussion examples made by humans and systems, respectively. In both discussion examples, the system can assign labels to Human1 and Human2 as indicated by the prompts. The first system example can derive a label that matches the gold label and can discuss the differences between the premise and hypothesis in the same way as humans. In the second system example, the final predicted label differs from the gold label. On the other hand, both the system and human discussions refer to the meaning of a picture and a photograph. While humans determine the final label from the general case, the system determines the final label in terms of lexical ambiguity. Therefore, the systemâ€™s discussion, although different from the gold label, is not necessarily incorrect.
