Section: Methods
5% CO2. TFAP2A co-immunoprecipitation HeLa cell protein lysates were generated with 0.5% NP-40 lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40) with phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, PPC1010). Samples were incubated with 5 µg agarose-conjugated TFAP2A primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-12726 AC) overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed, then boiled in Laemmli loading buffer (BioRad, 1610737). Proteins were separated on 10% Tris-Glycine gels (ThermoFisher, XP00100), transferred to PVDF (Immobilon-P, IPVH00010) and probed with primary antibodies against TFAP2A (ABclonal, A2294), ZFX (ThermoFisher, PA5-34376) and b -ACTIN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778) followed by chemiluminescence detection. Data avaliability Bulk RNA-sequencing of B-ALL Patients published in our previous study19 is acquired at SRA (PRJNA534488). Human transcription factor protein interaction networks are downloaded from supplementary data of Helka, et al17. Training data and trained model will be open sourced upon publication. 7/8
