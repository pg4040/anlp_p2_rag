[39] (see also [21]). is presented in figure 3 in the energy range from 46 GeV to 316 TeV, compared to indirect p+He measurements. The error bars represent the 1ùúé statistical uncertainties. The continuous bands indicate the systematic uncertainties related to the analysis procedure (inner band) and the overall systematic uncertainties (outer band), including the uncertainties of the hadronic interaction model which represent the most significant contributor, accounting for approximately 10-15%. Other sources of uncertainties, associated with the analysis procedure, are the differences between MC and satellite data when calculating the efficiencies of various selection cuts. Additionally, variations in the MC proton and helium mixtures are considered, affecting the spectrum by a few percent and included within the inner systematic band. The high energy region (approximately from 7 TeV to 130 TeV) of the proton+helium spectrum has been fitted using a smoothly-broken power-law (SBPL) function¬ß. The fit indicates the presence of a spectral softening at 28.8+6.2‚àí4.4 TeV with a significance of 6.6ùúé and confirms the previous DAMPE results in both proton and helium spectra [17, 18]. ¬ßa similar approach was adopted in previous studies such as [17, 18, 40, 41] P o S ( I C R C 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 8 Moreover, the result from this work is consistent with indirect measurements, although further observations from future space-borne experiments (e.g., HERD [42, 43]) and a spectral extension at higher energies are required to provide further insights. Notably, the p+He spectrum provides a new indication of a potential second hardening around 150 TeV, supported by preliminary findings from the HAWC collaboration [44], and giving hints to the existence of PeVatrons [45].
