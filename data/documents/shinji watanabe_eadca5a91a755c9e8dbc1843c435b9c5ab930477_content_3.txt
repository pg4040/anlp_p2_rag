(7) becomes the reciprocal lattice vector, i.e. q = Q h̃k̃l̃ , where Q h̃k̃l̃ ≡ h̃b1 + k̃b2 + l̃b3 with integer h̃ , k̃ , and l̃ . Then, we obtain FL(Qh̃k̃l̃) = 1 . As h̃, k̃ , and l̃ deviate from the integer values, FL(q) decays rapidly in the finite-size system. For the bulk limit, i.e., N1 → ∞ , FL(q) becomes zero for non-integer h̃ , k̃ , and l̃ , which yields FL(q) = δq,Q h̃k̃l̃ . Then, it tuns out that the convolution form in Eq. (4) indicates that the q vector giving Fs(q) = 0 is restricted to the integer values of h̃ , k̃ , and l̃ where FL(q) becomes non zero. We have calculated Fs(q) in N1 → ∞ for q = 2πa (h, k, l) where h, k, and l are defined by h ≡ k̃ + l̃ , k ≡ h̃+ l̃ , and l ≡ h̃+ k̃ , respectively. For (h, k, l) ∈ [−10, 10] , the maximum of Fs(q) is identified to be 0.215 at (h, k, l) = (±8,±4, 0) , (0,±8,±4) , and (±4, 0,±8) . We plot Fs(q) for q = 2πa (h, k, 0) in the h-k plane in Fig. 2A. We have also calculated Fs(q) for q = 2πa (h, 0, l) in the l-h plane at k = 0 and Fs(q) for q = 2π a (0, k, l) in the k-l plane at h = 0 . The results are the same as those in Fig. 2A where h and k are replaced with l and h respectively and k and l respectively. It is noted here that Eq. (4) is also applied to the QC, where FL(q) is the structure factor of the QC lattice. Here, to get insight into the magnetic structure on the IC, let us analyze SIC(q) in a single IC for general q . We have searched the maximum in SIC(q) for h, k, l ∈ [−10, 10]
