for 3 to 5 administrations for bone and joint infections and endocarditis, while 6 mg/kg q12h for 3 administrations for other infections. However, a study by Cazaubon et al. (Cazaubon et al., 2017) revealed that a loading dose regimen with 5 administrations of either 400 (approximately 6 mg/kg) or 600 mg (approximately 9 mg/kg) was not sufficient to achieve the target Cmin, 72h ≥ 15 mg/L in most patients, and at least 800 mg (approximately 12 mg/kg) should be used to achieve this target with a PTA ≥90%. This finding was in agreement with previous research (Brink et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2016; Nakano et al., 2016). Similar conclusions were obtained in this study in septic patients, suggesting that at least 800 mg (about 12 mg/kg) is required to achieve the target of Cmin, 72h ≥ 15 mg/L regardless of patients’ renal function (Figure 3). Besides, the present study revealed that increasing the dosing frequency was even more likely to enhance teicoplanin trough concentrations at 72 h than increasing unit doses (take the Cmin, 72h of 10 mg/kg for 5 administrations compared to 12 mg/kg for 3 administrations in Figure 3A as an example). Higher loading doses can provide higher drug exposure at the start of treatment, but the difference appears to diminish after 14 days when different loading doses are followed by the same maintenance dose, therefore, a sufficient maintenance dose seems important (Ahn et al., 2011). Maintenance dose is mainly reflected in Cmin, 240h and AUC0-24/MIC, according to our simulation, at low maintenance doses such as 5 mg/kg or 7.5 mg/kg, neither Cmin, 240h nor AUC0-24/MIC could reach the target (GFR 90 and 120 mL/min/ 1.73 m2, maintenance dose 7.5 mg/kg q24h, Table 3); even when Cmin, 240h exceeded the target value, AUC0-24/MIC still could not meet the standard (GFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, maintenance dose 7.5 mg/kg q24h; GFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, maintenance dose 5 mg/kg q24h, Table 3). Additionally, our data found that for renal insufficient patients, extending the dosing interval was more likely to bring the AUC0-24/MIC to the target than reducing the unit dose, though the concentrations obtained by both methods may be similar (GFR 15, 30, and 60 mL/min/ 1.73 m2, Table 3). The reason may be that the PK/PD index for FIGURE 3 Median teicoplanin Cmin, 72h with different loading doses in subgroups stratified by GFR.
