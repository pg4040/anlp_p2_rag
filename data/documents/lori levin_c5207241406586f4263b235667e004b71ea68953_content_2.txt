Section: 1 Introduction
the alternation shown in example (1). We then compare the performance of LMs to both human judgements and corpus statistics. Probing for LMs for their knowledge of agentivity in syntactic constructions as in (1) and (2) is a particularly insightful case study as it allows us to explore three interconnected questions in a highly controlled syntactic setting: I. Do models display sensitivity to aspects of word-level semantics independent of syntactic context, and is such sensitivity aligned with human judgements? (§3.1) II. Can models employ lexical semantics to determine the appropriate semantics of a sentence where the syntax is ambiguous between readings (as in 1)? (§3.2) III. Can models determine the semantics of a sentence from syntax, disregarding lexical semantics when necessary (as in 2)? (§3.3) Additionally, the relatively infrequent pairings of semantic function and syntactic form of sentences such as (1b) are also interesting from a learnability and acquisition perspective for both LMs and humans. How both come to process and acquire exceptions to a general “rule” has been a topic of debate since early connectionist models (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986). Hence, knowledge of LM capabilities in acquiring and processing these linguistic anomalies may serve as valuable insight to linguists, cognitive scientists, and NLP practitioners alike.
