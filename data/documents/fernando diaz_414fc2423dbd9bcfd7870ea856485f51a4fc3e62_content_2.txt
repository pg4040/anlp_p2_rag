this comparison. These findings are of great interest, as SGA-LAIs are associated with metabolic parameters increase. However, SGA-LAIs were associated with weight gain and increased body mass index during long-term use. Another study comparing paliperidone palmitate at different dosages (50mg, 100mg, and 150mg) versus placebo over a three-month period in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia evaluated safety outcomes. The overall incidence of TEAEs did not differ significantly between the groups. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms and glucose increase as TEAEs was low. However, clinically significant weight gain was more frequently observed in the paliperidone palmitate group (12% for 50 mg, 10% for 100 mg, 4% for 150 mg) compared to the placebo group (2%).23 A study comparing paliperidone palmitate (at dosages of 50mg, 100mg, and 150mg) and risperidone LAI (at dosages of 25mg, 37.5mg, and 50mg) over a 13-week period, assessing safety through TEAEs, clinical laboratory findings, EPS, electrocardiogram findings, and physical examination findings, found no significant differences between the two groups, with no new findings compared to previous studies.24 Arch Neurocien (Mex) Comparative efficacy of first and second generation long-acting injectable antipsychotic in schizophrenic patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis 42 | archivosdeneurociencias.org Volume 28, number 2, year 2023
