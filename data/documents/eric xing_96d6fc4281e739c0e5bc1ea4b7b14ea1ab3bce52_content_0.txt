Section: 4. Results and summary
After the above analysis, a preliminary result about the charge spectrum of elements (20≤Z≤40) could be obtained. Thanks to these corrections, the charge resolution is improved to 0.27e for iron. This is a crucial prerequisite for next analysis of relative abundance and flux energy spectrum of heavy nuclei beyond iron in cosmic rays.
