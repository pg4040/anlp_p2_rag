Section: 3.3 Possible causes of climate change in the upper level atmosphere
the current study, the data observed by ground level automatic weather station (AWS) only represent local information, while the data detected at high altitude usually have a larger range of representativeness. In this study, the AWS is located in an airport. In order to ensure the safety of aircrafts taking off and landing, there are strict restrictions on the height of buildings around the airport. Therefore, the data observed by the AWS mainly reflects the local climate characteristics of low-density built-up areas similar to the suburbs. While at high altitudes, the observational data are representative in a much larger range due to the advection transportation and turbulent mixing of energy and mass. Under such conditions, the impact of high-rise buildings in urban built-up areas far away from the airport may gradually emerge. This is possibly the reason why the impact of the increase of the number of skyscrapers is more obvious in the higher elevation.
