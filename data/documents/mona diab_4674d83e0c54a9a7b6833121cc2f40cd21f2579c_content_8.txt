Section: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
% o f C el l V ia b ili ty Time (hr) Cell Viability Assay HT29 Mock Pool Cl2 A B hygromycin B-resistant cell lines. Cell proliferation (A) and cell viability (B) assays for HT29 stable cell lines (Mock, Pool, Cl2) compared to non-transfected HT29 cells, respectively. (C) Wound healing assays for HT29 and same stably transformed cell lines at different time points. (D) The bar graphs represent the mean of gap closure ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. A B Figure 9: PAMR1 reduces HT29 and HeLa cells proliferation and migration. Cell proliferation assay for HT29 (A) and HeLa cells (B) in different conditions. Non treated: WT cells exogenously treated with concentrated CHOmPAMR1 secretome. “Treated” corresponds to exogenously treated HT29 with concentrated CHO-mPAMR1 secretome. “Transfected” corresponds to transiently transfected cells by pCDNA3.1-hPAMR1. “Transfected + Treated” means that transfected cells were exogenously treated by concentrated CHO-mPAMR1 secretome. The bar graph represents mean ± SEM. * p < 0.05, **p < 0.001. Wound healing assays for non-transfected HT29 and transiently transfected HT29 (C) and HeLa (D) cells at different time points. The bar graphs represent the mean of gap closure ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. C D
