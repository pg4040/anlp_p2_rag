Section: 3.3 Facial AM Prediction
to reject 𝐻0, we only need to find a counterexample to show that voice is indeed useful in predicting AM 𝑚 (𝑘 ) . An effective example is to compare the estimators with and without the voice input. If there exists a learned estimator 𝐹𝑘 (𝑣) performing better than the chance-level estimator 𝐶𝑘 without using voice input and the results are statistically significant, we can successfully reject 𝐻0 and accept 𝐻1. Here the chance-level estimator for the 𝑘-th AM is a constant 𝐶𝑘 = 1 |D𝑡 | ∑ 𝑚 (𝑘 ) ∈D𝑡 𝑚 (𝑘 ) , which is the mean 𝑚 (𝑘 ) of the training set D𝑡 . So the null and alternative hypothesis can be rewritten as 𝐻0 : 𝜇 (𝜖𝑘/𝜖𝐶𝑘 ) ≤ 1 𝐻1 : 𝜇 (𝜖𝑘/𝜖𝐶𝑘 ) ≥ 1 where 𝜖𝑘 and 𝜖𝐶𝑘 are the mean square errors of estimators with and without voice inputs on validation set D𝑣2, respectively. The formulations of 𝜖𝑘 and 𝜖𝐶𝑘 are given as 𝜖𝑘 = 1 |D𝑣2 | ∑ 𝑚 (𝑘 ) ∈D𝑣2 (?̂? (𝑘 )−𝑚 (𝑘 ) )2 and 𝜖𝐶 𝑘 = 1|D𝑣2 | ∑ 𝑚 (𝑘 ) ∈D𝑣2 (𝐶𝑘 −𝑚 (𝑘 ) )2. Since the true variance of 𝜖𝑘/𝜖𝐶𝑘 is unknown, the type of hypothesis testing is one-sided paired-sample t-test. The upper bound of the confidence interval (CI) is given by 𝐶𝐼𝑢 = 𝜇 (𝜖𝑘/𝜖𝐶𝑘 ) + 𝑡1−𝛼,𝜈 · 𝜎 (𝜖𝑘/𝜖𝐶𝑘 )√ 𝑁 (4) where 𝜇 (·) and 𝜎 (·) are the functions for computing mean and standard deviation respectively. 𝑁 is the number of the repeated experiments and we set 𝑁 = 100 here. 𝛼 and 𝜈 = 𝑁 − 1 are the significance level and the degree of freedom respectively. For the purpose of this section, we adopt the significance level of 5% and then we can read 𝑡0.95,𝑁−1 from t-distribution table. Now we can determine whether to reject 𝐻0 and accept 𝐻1,i.e., the AM𝑚 (𝑘 ) is predictable from voice. According to the experimental results, the probability that the aforementioned decision is correct is higher than 95%,i.e., statistically significant. In contrast, 𝐶𝐼𝑢 ≥ 1 implies that we fail to reject 𝐻0, for the current experimental results are not statistically significant enough. Note that failing to reject 𝐻0 does not imply we accept 𝐻0. We emphasize that it is necessary to compute 𝜖𝐶 𝑘 and 𝜖𝑘 on D𝑣2 rather than D𝑡 or D𝑣1. This is because our estimators are trained on D𝑡 and selected by the errors on D𝑣1, we can easily get significantly lower 𝜖𝑘
