Authors: Jing Chen, Shichuan Zhang
Section: 
the reasons for the enhanced antibacterial activity of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials, the photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism was explored through SEM observation of bacterial surface morphology and free radical scavenging experiments, and the structure and reactive oxygen generation of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials were analyzed relationship. Finally, the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and practical applicability of the composite material were determined by the livestock and poultry wastewater collected in real life. 2. Experimental Section 2.1. Materials E. coli (ATCC 25922), S. aureus (ATCC 6538), P. aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) used in this experiment were from the China Culture Collection Center. The LB medium was used as the nutrient source for bacteria, and the Martin medium was used as the nutrient source for fungi. Bi2O3, SnO2, Sb2O5, ZnO and NaCl were purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Company. Agar, Glutaraldehyde, and Isoamyl Acetate were from Obersin Biotechnology. 2.2. Preparation of BiSnSbO6 The solid phase sintering method is used. Mix Bi2O3: SnO2: Sb2O5 in a molar ratio of 1:2:1 (P. Huang et al. 2019), put the materials in an agate mortar and mix and grind, and dry for 4 h. Put the ground powder into a corundum crucible and put it into a high temperature mu e furnace for calcination. The calcination temperature changed as follows: 80 min from 20°C to 350°C, hold for 240 min, 80 min to 720°C, hold for 240 min, and nally 60 min from 720°C to 900°C, hold for 1500 min. 2.3. Preparation of BiSnSbO6-ZnO Composite The rst step was to weigh and mix BiSnSbO6 and ZnO in a certain molar ratio. The second step was to grind the mixed material. The third step was to put the powder into a corundum crucible and press it into a cake, paying attention to the thickness. Finally, it was put into a high temperature mu e furnace for calcination. The BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material was obtained by maintaining the heating rate of 4.4 ℃/min for 200 min, heating up to 900 ℃, holding at 900 ℃ for 1500 min, and cooling to room temperature after calcination. BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials were prepared by changing the molar ratio of 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5, respectively. 2.4. Characterization The material crystal structure was tested using Cu ka radiation XRD (Rigaku Smart-Lab). SEM (Regulus 8100), TEM (H-8100EM) and EDS (Bruker XFlash 6l60) were used to understand the microscopic morphology and elemental composition of the samples for characterization.
