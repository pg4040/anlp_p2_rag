Section: If it relates to people, were they provided with privacy guarantees? If so, what guarantees and how are these ensured?
Data does not relate directly to people. Does the dataset comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? Does it comply with any other standards, such as the US Equal Employment Opportunity Act? Especially because the data does not relate to people or have personally identifiable information, it does comply with these laws. Does the dataset contain information that might be considered sensitive or confidential? (e.g., personally identifying information) Does the dataset contain information that might be considered inappropriate or offensive? No, the dataset does not contain sensitive or confidential information (like personally identifiable information). The dataset does potentially contain inappropriate or offensive text, especially in the demo-sourced situations, and we advise that the dataset is not for all eyes before providing access. While we did not want to completely remove inappropriate or offensive situations so that the model could perform well in surfacing relevant values, rights, and duties in these cases, we did attempt to ensure that the generated data does not include inappropriate or offensive content via manual inspection and toxicity filters.
