finally split into 80% training and 20% validation, resulting in a529 64-16-20 split for train-validation-test where the train and validation sets are bootstrapped to evaluate model variance.530 We use early-stopping with a patience of 5 to end training when the minimum validation loss has not been improved531 for 5 epochs. We retain only the model with the minimum validation loss for each bootstrap. In Table 1, we evaluate532 these bootstraps individually to get error means and variances. Following this, we apply each of our bootstrapped533 models to the non-bootstrapped training-validation set and average the outputs of each model to obtain a single graph534 for each patient in this set, which we evaluate in-depth in Figures 4, 5, and 6, and for all disease types in Appendix S4.535 The context encoder is a highly flexible component of our framework and a driving force for future work. This536 attribute can be used to enforce assumptions about the relationships between contexts and models, between context537 features, and about the archetype space. For instance, by using a neural additive model instead of a multi-layer538 perceptron, we provide context-feature-specific archetype weights for interpretability. Similarly, we can augment539 our context encoder with a convolutional base and include imaging modalities in our context views. At the context540 encoder head, we currently use an unconstrained output, but applying a softmax activation would require all of the541 sample-specific models to lie within a polytope defined by the archetypal networks.542 S2 Data543 S2.1 Data sources544 The Cancer Genome Atlas3 (TCGA) is a publicly-available pan-cancer datasource containing genomic, transcriptomic,545 and clinical profiling of tumors from dozens of landmark studies. We queried TCGA for samples with bulk RNA-546 sequencing and merged this dataset with two follow-up studies on an overlapping set of patients.547 Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) SCNAs affect a larger fraction of the genome than do any other type548 of somatic genetic alteration [57] and are a major driver of expression variation in cancer [58]. We used copy number549 profiles derived from TCGA samples using ASCAT [59] from a pan-cancer study of the role of allele-specific SCNAs550 in cancer [60].551 Driver single-nucleotide mutations (SNVs) SNVs can be classified into "driver" mutations thought to provide552 selective growth advantage and "passenger" mutations thought to have little role in promoting cancer development.553 We incorporated driver SNVs from the TCGA-derived CHASMplus dataset [61]554 3www.cancer.gov/tcga S1 S2.2 Context data views555 Clinical information This data view incorporates sample tissue-of-origin, race, age at diagnosis, gender, year of556 birth, and days to collection provided by TCGA.557 Biopsy Composition
