Section: 6 SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
cognitively and neurally-inspired models have the potential to advance the ability of AI systems to use afective phenomena in order to better understand human social behaviors and cognitive states. (3) Expanding Multimodal Social Interaction Contexts: We fnd that a majority of the papers in our sample focus on monadic contexts, with a limited focus on challenges present in dyadic and multi-party contexts. We recommend that future research eforts explore how AI systems can better integrate afective state predictions from multiple people and multiple contexts to inform models of social behaviors and cognitive states in group-level dynamics. For example, how can an AI system integrate its afect predictions of both people in a dyad in order to predict their synchrony (grouplevel behavior) [75]? How can afective state predictions of one person in a multi-party interaction inform an AI system’s understanding of behavior and cognition in other participants? (4) Expanding Application Areas: We fnd that several of the papers successfully used afective phenomena to model social behaviors and cognitive states in the domains of healthcare (e.g., modeling depression, doctor-patient communication dynamics) [26, 61–63, 65, 66, 72, 78] and education (e.g., modeling student learning dynamics) [2, 17, 69]. We recommend that future research eforts further explore how afective phenomena can be used as features, auxiliary tasks, and latent states to improve AI systems that support human health, education, and well-being through applications and empirical validation in additional populations and social contexts. Since it is possible that afective phenomena might not be useful to inform models in all settings, we recommend that future research explore techniques to enable AI systems to efciently estimate when they need to query afective state information from their environment in order to improve their understanding of the social behaviors and cognitive states of the people around them.
