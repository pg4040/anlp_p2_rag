are working on the estimation of the significance of this important observation, along with a more in-depth study of the systematic uncertainties. Figure 7: The new (presented at this conference) cosmic-ray proton and helium spectra shown as a function of kinetic energy per nucleon (left) and rigidity (right). The vertical dashed lines indicate the most probable break positions obtained from the fit procedure along with the corresponding uncertainties. Figure from [32]. Finally, we have also performed a combined proton+helium spectrum measurement, submitted for publication earlier this year [35] (Figure 8). While agreeing well with the previously reported individual proton and helium spectra, this analysis extends to a much higher kinetic energy of 316 TeV, thanks to significantly larger combined statistics. Intriguingly, the new results suggest a hint of a new spectral hardening at ∼150 TeV [36], establishing at the same time a strong link between space- and ground-based experiments.
