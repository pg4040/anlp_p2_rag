Section: A.5.3 Restricted Timetable Problem (RTT)
(by our definition of α. • This r distribution has only entries in α or 0. This follows by definition. • This r distribution has minimum conditional entropy. For a fixed i, j, r(i, j, ⋅) is either α or 0. That is, Y is deterministic given X1,X2, hence H(Y ∣X1,X2) = 0. • All 3 marginal constraints in our construction are obeyed. We check them in turn. – Marginal constraint r(i, j) = p(i, j). When i ∈ [3]: (i) when Rij = 1 exactly one time h is assigned to teacher i and class j, hence r(i, j) = α = p(i, j) as required, (ii)when Rij = 0 as specified. Now when i ∈ {Z1, Z2, Z3}, we have r(i, j, ⋅) = α = p(i, j) since every holding room is either assigned it’s color to a class, or assigned the special null color. – Marginal constraint r(i, h) = p(i, h). When i ∈ [3], this follows directly from tightness. Similarly, when i ∈ {Z1, Z2, Z3}, we have by definition of Q-RTT the assignments to holding rooms equal to m − qh for hour h, and consequently, qh null colors adjacent to Zh as required. – Marginal constraint r(j, h) = p(j, h). For every h ∈ [3], the class is assigned either to a teacher or a holding room, so this is equal to α as required. For h = 0, i.e., the null color, this is used exactly ∑i∈[n]Rij times (since these were the number hours that were not assigned to teachers), as required, making its marginal ∑i∈[n]Rij and r(j, h) = α ⋅∑i∈[n]Rij as required. Thus, if RTT returns TRUE, our construction will also return a solution with entries in {0, α}, and vice versa. Corollary The decision problem of whether there exists a distribution in r ∈ ∆p1,2,12 such that H(Y ∣X1,X2) = 0 is NP-complete. This follows because the problem is in NP since checking if Y is deterministic (i.e., H(Y ∣X1,X2) = 0) can be done in polynomial time, while NP-hardness follows from the same argument as above.
