Title: Multi-Objective Improvement of Android Applications
Authors: James, Callan, Justyna Petke
Section: 1 Introduction
find patches that improve execution time by up to 35%, and memory usage by up to 65%. Unfortunately, no improvements to bandwidth use were found. Such improvements are within GIDroid’s search space, which leaves room for future work for more effective search strategies. To sum up, we present the following novel contributions: 1. An open-source, simulation-based tool, GIDroid (GIDroid (2023)), for automated multi-objective improvement of Android applications’ runtime, memory, and bandwidth use. 2. A benchmark of 21 versions of 7 Android applications, including tests, for future work on performance improvement in the Android domain. 3. An evaluation of the effectiveness of 3 multi-objective genetic improvement algorithms at improving runtime, memory use, and bandwidth of Android applications. No GI work has targeted 3 properties before. 4. A comparison between both multi- and single-objective genetic improvement approaches for automated optimization of Android applications. 5. An empirical comparison of our multi-objective GI-based approach for Android application performance improvement with state-of-the-art linters. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes related work; Section 3 presents an introduction to genetic improvement and multi-objective optimization; Section 4 presents challenges of applying GI to the Android domain and our proposed framework that overcomes these challenges; Section 5 presents research questions we aim to answer to evaluate our approach, with Section 6 outlining our methodology; Section 7 presents our results, with threats to validity presented in Section 8; Section 9 concluding. 1At the time of our experiments, none of the automated test generation tools for Android were compatible with latest Android software, thus we had to manually create tests to evaluate our MO-GI approach.
