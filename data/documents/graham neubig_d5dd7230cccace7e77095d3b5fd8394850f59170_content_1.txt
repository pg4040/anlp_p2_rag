culture, such as food, mythology, famous people, or plants and animals native to specific regions. We benchmark multilingual model performance (ยง5) and analyze model failures (ยง6), finding that zero-shot performance of multilingual models is relatively poor, especially for lower-resource languages. According to (Liu et al., 2021), main factors which poses challenges on the performance in such cases are cross-lingual transfer and concept shift across languages. However, we observe that concept shift seems to play a larger role due to culturally specific examples. Adding a few examples in the target language can improve performance of larger models, but this is more beneficial for lower-resource languages. This highlights the importance of including culturally relevant training data, particularly data that highlights not just the existence of a concept, but also how people view that concept within that culture.
