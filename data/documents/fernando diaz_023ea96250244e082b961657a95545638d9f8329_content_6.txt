Patients with CC have comprehensive health insurance, which means that the state subsidises the direct costs of medical care. For CTRT and HDRBT, the hospital covers the cost of medication; associated supplies, equipment and infrastructure; and the work of healthcare professionals. However, finance and equipment are less than the demand, so it is pertinent to make managerial decisions, supported by efficiency and in addition to the associated costs, as this will allow more cancer treatments to be offered [16, 17]. It is expected that, by 2040, the increased incidence and mortality will be disproportionately higher in low (LIC) and middle-income countries (MIC), with an estimated 72% higher incidence and 76% higher mortality in countries with low-to-medium HDI (Peru or Indonesia). This imbalance in the cancer burden is compounded by current disparities in resources for combatting cancer, which must be addressed as a priority [18, 19]. Cl in ic al S tu dy ecancer 2023,
