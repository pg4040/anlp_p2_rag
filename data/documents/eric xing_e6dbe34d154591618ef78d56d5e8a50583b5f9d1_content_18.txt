Section: 
This data view contains the sample’s percent tumor cells, percent normal cells, percent tumor558 nuclei, percent monocyte infiltration, percent lymphocyte infiltration, and percent neutrophil infiltration provided by559 TCGA. We also incorporate expression-derived estimates of the fraction of a sample consisting of tumor cells from560 [60].561 Copy Number Alterations From ASCAT [59], we gather whole genome doubling events as well as gain and loss562 events for bp-specific regions of hg19 based on data from [62]. We transform these gain and loss events into both arm-563 level and gene-level events, where arm-level events affect 85% of an entire arm in the same event, while genes-level564 events affect a single gene. We transform these into number of major and number of minor chromosome arms, and565 the number of major and minor alleles for the set of 295 genes that overlap between COSMIC [63] and MSigDB [64].566 For both gene and arm-level events, we create a separate indicator for loss of heterozygosity on each gene.567 Driver Mutations From CHASMplus [61] we gather the mutations on all COSMIC [63] oncogenes/tumor suppresor568 genes and binarize the presence or absence of a mutation in each gene.569 S2.3 Transcriptomic data views570 Transcriptomics We take the set of known oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes annotated in COSMIC [63] and571 included in TCGA gene expression panels. We then calculate the variance of each gene in each tumor type and take a572 weighted sum of these variances according to the total number of samples in each tumor type. We select the top 100573 genes by this metric of “intra-disease variance”.574 Baselines We are not aware of any other scalable meta-learning, deep learning, or varying-coefficient methods to575 produce context-informed correlation, Markov, and Bayesian networks under a universal framework. As such, our576 baselines apply the network estimators in S1 under several well-known and general paradigms for improving model577 personalization, broadly relating to cluster analysis. Our population baseline provides no personalization, learning a578 single model for the entire population of training samples. Our context-clustered baseline takes an unsupervised ap-579 proach to personalization by first doing a k-means clustering with k=25 on the aggregated context views (S2) and then580 inferring cluster-specific networks. Our disease-clustered baseline uses a personalization oracle, grouping samples by581 tumor type and then inferring disease-specific networks.582 S3 Related work583 State-of-the-art gene regulatory network estimators are limited to population, cohort, and cluster-based approaches584 [26, 65, 66]. Other proposals to estimate networks as the difference between a population model and a sample-left-585 out model lack statistical power [30].
