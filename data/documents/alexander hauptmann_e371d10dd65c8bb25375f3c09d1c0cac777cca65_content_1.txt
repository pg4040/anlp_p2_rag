ℓ2). The curvatures used in the latter were 0.006, 0.002 in 1s5w, 5s5w (CUB) and 0.002, 0.0002 in 1s5w, 5s5w (Mini), respectively. As posited, when d increases the Poincaré embeddings approach the effective radius. In fact, plugging ϵ = 0.01 in (7) we obtain reff = 4.47 for k = −0.05, reff = 9.99 for k = −0.01 and reff = 14.13 for k = −0.005. In the CUB dataset, the 5s5w training configuration avoids boundary saturation up to d = 512, however, the results are worse than the fixed-radius Euclidean architecture for the same dimensions. In MiniImageNet 5s5w, we observe embeddings not at the boundary for the largest dimension d = 1024 considered. That being the case, the test accuracy is higher than that obtained in lower dimensions with embeddings farther from reff . Note that in the two datasets considered, we observed the same Euclidean versus hyperbolic ProtoNet fewshot accuracy gap reported in prior work [12,13], especially in the 1s5w setting. However, the empirical advantage of hyperbolic representations no longer holds once normalized Euclidean embeddings together with the ℓ2-norm are introduced in the benchmark. In fact, even when Poincaré embeddings yield better results, the difference w.r.t fixedradius embeddings is minor. Further, this is verified across all the dimensions considered, unlike e.g., graph or word embeddings where, in low dimensions, hyperbolic space offers a sizeable advantage. Finally, results on the effect of magnitude clipping in high-dimensions for the CUB dataset are shown in Table 5. These experiments were performed for d = 1024, k = −0.05 and using Riemannian gradient as mentioned in the original paper. For each clipping value c, the corresponding effective ball radius can be obtained by plugging c in the exponential map (8) and taking the ℓ2-norm. Thus, for c = 2, 3 and 4 we have 1.877, 2.618 and 3.191, respectively. We see the saturation effect occurring, especially for larger clipping values, where the test accuracy is coincidentally higher.
