Section: 3 D2. Did you report information about how you recruited (e.g., crowdsourcing platform, students)
and paid participants, and discuss if such payment is adequate given the participants’ demographic (e.g., country of residence)? Section Ethical Statement. 7 D3. Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you’re using/curating? For example, if you collected data via crowdsourcing, did your instructions to crowdworkers explain how the data would be used? No, the human annotators are required to just rewrite the automatic data, which is unnecessary to give a instruction. 7 D4. Was the data collection protocol approved (or determined exempt) by an ethics review board? Our benchmark has no social impacts and we just use some open knowledge bases, like ConceptNet and Wikidata. There is no need to get the approval of an ethics review board. 7 D5. Did you report the basic demographic and geographic characteristics of the annotator population that is the source of the data? No, we required the annotators to avoid any social bias and privacy issues in the rewritten material, which is discussed in the Section Ethical Statement.
