Section: 
sacrificing586 statistical power by using an approach similar to classic varying-coefficient models that weighs samples by their587 distance over context [67]. However, this approach inherently assumes smoothness of the parameters over a context,588 which does not align with our understanding of the non-linear, switch-like changes in biological systems that lead589 to disease. Contextual estimation networks (CENs) remove this smoothness assumption by inferring the relationship590 between context and model parameters with a neural network, but the CEN framework is only proposed as an adaptive591 learning approach for linear models [41]. Context-varying linear models have previously been applied to multi-omic592 cancer data, where context-varying coefficients inform how epigenetic markers have patient-specific effects on clinical593 outcomes [42]. Linear models do not inform us of the differential gene-gene interactions that explain changes in594 cellular behavior. To understand regulatory and metabolic variation at per-sample resolution, we require network595 models with context-varying structures and parameters.596 S2 S4 Extra Results597 S3 Disease Type TCGA Subtypes Expression Subtypes Network Subtypes BLCA 0.411 0.151 0.713 BRCA 1.484 0.616 1.558 CHOL – – – COAD 0.016 0.014 1.219 DLBC – – – ESCA 0.044 0.884 0.049 GBM 1.644 0.958 0.101 HNSC 1.209 0.312 3.465 KICH 0.715 13.802 0.211 KIRC 5.042 6.109 13.741 KIRP 14.538 10.582 15.205 LGG 48.338 33.438 49.681 LIHC 0.009 0.427 0.827 LUAD 0.687 1.172 0.507 LUSC 0.123 0.105 0.249 OV 0.704 0.684 0.05 PAAD 0.439 1.104 1.494 PRAD – – – READ 0.221 0.203 0.117 SKCM – – – STAD 0.044 1.117 0.575 THCA 0.298 0.164 2.104 UCEC 6.937 3.343 7.07 UCS 0.319 0.023 0.048 UVM 4.838 2.589 3.565 Table S1: Multivariate log-rank test comparison across different subtyping methods in terms of -log(p-value).
