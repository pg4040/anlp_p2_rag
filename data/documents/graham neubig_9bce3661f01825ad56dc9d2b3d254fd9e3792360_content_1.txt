sufficient in practice as pointed out by Lakkaraju et al. (2022). Instead of directly predicting answers, CoT uses natural language to derive answers step-bystep (Wei et al., 2022). This leads to complex multistep inferences. By adding the phrase “Let’s think step by step” before each answer, Kojima et al. (2022) demonstrate that language models are competent zero-shot CoT. On the other hand, Wang et al. (2022a) shows that CoT can achieve competitive performance even with invalid reasoning steps in the prompt. CoT’s step-by-step approach is based on the system only, whereas our proposed method incorporates human involvement in the system to facilitate collaboration between humans and the system. Additionally, our approach utilizes discussions for a step-by-step thinking process. Research is also being conducted on the use of natural language by humans to provide instructions and feedback to the system. Abramson et al. (2022) has developed multi-modal grounded language agents that perform reinforcement learning on human dialogue-based instructions. Sharma et al. (2022) proposed a method to integrate humanprovided feedback in natural language to update a robot’s planning cost applied to situations when the planner fails. Murty et al. (2022) proposed a method to modify a model by natural language patches and achieved performance improvement in sentiment analysis and relationship extraction tasks. Campos and Shern (2022) proposed a method for training a model to behave in line with human preferences, by learning from natural language feedback, in text summarization. On the other hand, these studies cannot be explained or questioned by the system to humans.
