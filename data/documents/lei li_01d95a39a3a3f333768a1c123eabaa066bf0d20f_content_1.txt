targets for P53. The expression of P53 horizontally induces the expression of miR-34 after transcription by binding to the DROSHA complex (Rokavec et al., 2014). In particular, miR34a has the highest expression in the brain. As was reported, miR-34a could regulate the differentiation of neurons and the growth of axons. In the brain tissue of AD patients, it was found that its expression was up-regulated. John R. Dickson’s study found that changes in the expression of miR-34a can regulate the expression of tau in the pathogenesis of AD. The possible mechanism is that when the protein of tau aggregates, the up-regulation of miR-34a may be used as a compensation mechanism to reduce the expression of tua. This maight offer the opportunity to improve the prognosis of AD patients (Dickson et al., 2013). The miR-34a also regulates the expression of several synaptic proteins in cortical neurons (Jazvinšćak Jembrek et al., 2018). Oxidative stress is one of the conditions under which AD occurs. Under the condition of oxidative stress, P53 will react (Jazvinšćak Jembrek et al., 2018). Generally speaking, in mild oxidative damage, P53 can antioxidate to promote cell survival, while in severe oxidative stress, P53 can promote oxidative activity and lead to cell death (Jazvinšćak Jembrek et al., 2018). In human AD, the increase in the expression of P53 is directly proportional to the accumulation of Aβ protein in cells. Oxidative stress is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction, and P53 can protect mitochondrial function by promoting the production of new mitochondria (Jazvinšćak Jembrek et al., 2018).
