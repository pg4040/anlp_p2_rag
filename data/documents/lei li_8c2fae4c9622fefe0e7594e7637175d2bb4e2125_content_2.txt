However, obtaining vertical data is difficult, and meteorological administration departments did not require these data to be collected among operational observations for a long time. Thus, climate change across the vertical boundary layer has not been widely examined. Shenzhen is one of the main cities in the PRD region. In less than 40 years, Shenzhen has developed from a small city to a megacity with a population of over 10 million (Zhang et al., 2018). Shenzhen also has the densest meteorological observation network in the PRD region. Additionally, at Shenzhen’s Bao’an International Airport, a boundary layer radar wind profiler has been installed and has been operational since around 2011, gathering observation data for more than a decade. Using these data, we analysed changes in the climate of the upper level atmosphere with a maximum top height of 1,500 m, in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) region over a 10-year period, which is undoubtedly a progress when compared with the past studies on climate effect of urbanisation only based on the ground level observation.
