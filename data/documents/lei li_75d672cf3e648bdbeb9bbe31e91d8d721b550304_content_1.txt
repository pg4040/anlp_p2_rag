are more convincing compared with those obtained from other portions. The more true association pairs that are correctly retrieved from the top-ranked, the predictor is more effective. For this reason, we calculate the correct recovery of association pairs at different thresholds when all 664 known drug-miRNA association pairs are used as training samples. The top 10%, 15% and 20% drug-related miRNAs in prediction result, GNMFDMA correctly retrieved 429 (64.61%), 532 (80.12%) and 617 (92.92%) association pairs, respectively. The comparison between the original association adjacency matrix and the predicted association matrix is shown in Figure 3. These results show that GNMFDMA can effectively retrieve the true association pairs with a lower false negative rate. In summary, the method of GNMFDMA has powerful ability for identifying drugassociated miRNAs.
