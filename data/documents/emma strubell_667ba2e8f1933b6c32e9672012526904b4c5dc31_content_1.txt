well as instructing reviewers than senior researchers (11– 15 years with a p-value of 0.089 and 16+ years with a p-value of 0.085). Job Sector. In terms of the job sector, we again find no significant differences with respect to reviewers asking for too expensive experiments (𝑄10) or critique being justified (𝑄12). Interestingly, respondents from small industry received fewer such requests (𝑄11) compared to post-docs (p-value = 0.024), PIs (p-value= 0.061), and larger industry (p-value = 0.087). The most concerning trend can be observed when comparing the different groups with respect to their lack of compute resources to 4https://2022.naacl.org/blog/ reproducibility-track/ reproduce experiments (𝑄13, Fig. 8); where we find significant differences and conduct pairwise analyses.5 In general, students suffered most, with a significant difference compared to the large industry sector with a p-value of 0.002 < 0.005 = 𝛼 (Bonferroni-corrected). We further find substantial differences between students and academic PIs (pvalue = 0.026) and between academic post-docs and large industry labs (p-value = 0.088). We find no substantial differences when it comes to actionable items for the *CL community (𝑄14– 𝑄17), indicating that implementing popular ideas would be welcomed by all groups. However, we find some differences when it comes to encouraging the release of models (𝑄18). For instance, Figure 9d shows that academic post-docs had a higher preference towards reviewers rewarding papers that promise to release models than academic PIs. Also, participants from small industry would prefer visual branding over awards in contrast to large industry.
