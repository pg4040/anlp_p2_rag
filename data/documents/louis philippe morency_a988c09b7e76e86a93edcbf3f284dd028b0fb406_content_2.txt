X2 so I(X1;X2∣Y ) = 0: Sagree = 0 ≤ 0 = S. Note that this is an example of perfect redundancy and zero synergy - for an example with synergy, refer back to DISAGREEMENT XOR in Table 2a - due to disagreement there is non-zero I(X1;X2) but the label explains some of the relationships between X1 and X2 so I(X1;X2∣Y ) < I(X1;X2): Sagree = −0.3 ≤ 1 = S. A real-world example is multimodal sentiment analysis from text, video, and audio of monologue videos on MOSEI, R = 0.26 and S = 0.04, and as expected the lower bound is small Sagree = 0.01 ≤ 0.04 = S. 2. The relationship between disagreement and synergy: To give an intuition of the relationship between disagreement, uniqueness, and synergy, we use one illustrative example shown in Table 2a, which we call DISAGREEMENT XOR. We observe that there is maximum disagreement between marginals p(y∣x1) and p(y∣x2): the likelihood for y is high when y is the same bit as x1, but reversed for x2. Given both x1 and x2: y seems to take a ‘disagreement’ XOR of the individual marginals, i.e. p(y∣x1, x2) = p(y∣x1) XOR p(y∣x2), which indicates synergy (note that an exact XOR would imply perfect agreement and high synergy). The actual disagreement is 0.15, synergy is 0.16, and uniqueness is 0.02, indicating a very strong lower bound Sdisagree = 0.13 ≤ 0.16 = S. A real-world equivalent dataset is MUSTARD for sarcasm detection from video, audio, and text [14], where the presence of sarcasm is often due to a contradiction between what is expressed in language and speech, so disagreement α = 0.12 is the highest out of all the video datasets, giving a lower bound Sdisagree = 0.11 ≤ 0.44 = S. On the contrary, the lower bound is low when all disagreement is explained by uniqueness (e.g., y = x1, Table 2c), which results in Sdisagree = 0 ≤ 0 = S (α and U cancel each other out). A real-world equivalent is MIMIC involving mortality and disease prediction from tabular patient data and timeseries medical sensors [53]. Disagreement is high α = 0.13 due to unique information U1 = 0.25, so the lower bound informs us about the lack of synergy Sdisagree = −0.12 ≤ 0.02 = S. Finally, the lower bound is loose when there is synergy without disagreement, such as AGREEMENT XOR (y = x1 XOR x2, Table 2b) where the marginals p(y∣xi) are both uniform, but there is full synergy: Sdisagree =
