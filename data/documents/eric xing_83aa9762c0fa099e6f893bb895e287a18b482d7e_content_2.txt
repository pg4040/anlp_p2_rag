order of mental activeness and consistency is observed in surface, deep and genuine acting, which would consequently shape the level of attitudinal inclinations of the employee toward his or her career. As has been put by Chu and Murrmann (2006), emotional labor is a contagion that closely regulates the direction and intensity of other significant psychological traits. This is further supported by the natures of career competencies and career commitment, which are based on the subjective perceptions and evaluations made by the employee, are inherently underlined by emotion-laden foundations (Liu et al., 2004). When employees identifies with the work emotionally, they would be more motivated to accrue competencies which would better facilitate their career path, and be more loyal and committed to the career. This is especially the case under the scenarios of demanding job responsibilities or tough customers, when positive emotional labor would sustain and enhance the psychological attachment of the employee to the organization and prevent burnout and quitting (Brotheridge and Lee, 2003).
