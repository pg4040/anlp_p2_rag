Section: 5 Effects of the parameters on chaos
the transition from regularity to chaos occurs. As the black hole spin a is larger than 0.69, chaos disappears in Fig. 13b. The values of e ≥ 0.21 induce chaos almost anywhere in Fig. 13c. These facts show that chaos is easily induced as the magnetic field strength and particle positive charge increase or the black hole spin decreases. On the other hand, chaos is always present for any one of the black hole magnetic charges p when a smaller angular momentum L = 4.0 is taken in Fig. 13d. However, only several values of p admit chaos when a larger angular momentum L = 6.5 is used. We can also use the values of Kc to exhibit the distribution of order and chaos in the space of two parameters. In Fig. 14, the particles are electrically neutral, and the two parameters are q and one of B, E and L . Clearly, the regular and chaotic dynamics of neutral particles is not very sensitive dependence on the variation of q. Under some circumstances, the increase of B and E or the decrease of L can easily induce chaos from the statistical computations. When the particles have negative charges in Fig. 15a, chaos occurs easily as q increases. However, the chaotic motion of positive charge particles occurs easily as q decreases in Fig. 15b. The dependence of chaos on the black hole charge in the magnetized Kerr–Newman spacetime is similar to that in the magnetized RN spacetime [10]. There is no universal rule on the contribution of a variation of p to the transition from order to chaos in Fig. 15c, d. As a point to be illustrated, the parameters corresponding to regular and chaotic dynamics described by the values of Kc in Figs. 13, 14 and 15 are completely consistent with those shown by the FLIs.
