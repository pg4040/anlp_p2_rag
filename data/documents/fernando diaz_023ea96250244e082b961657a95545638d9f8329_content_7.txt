Radical RT plays an important role in the definitive treatment of locally-advanced disease, with 8-year survival rates of up to 67% when combined with concurrent CT [21]. Even in retrospective analysis, the addition of local RT at stage IVB seems to confer better results in specific survival [22, 23], which is why at our institution the treatment is offered to those with inguinal metastasis. The therapy administered with an HDRBT boost is the standard of care [24]; IMRT or VMAT have become standard therapy methods, compared to 3D [25]. The dose is determined and administered via new technologies, which use inverse optimisation algorithms, as they are consistent with the planned target area and provide a more even distribution [26]. There are many published studies on CTRT regimens that have been widely used in clinical practice. However, there is limited research on economic analysis. This is the first Latin American study that analyses the costs separated by clinical stage, comparing irradiation techniques. Unlike other studies that are based on annual projections by incidence [27], and others that only focus on the cost of human resources and infrastructure [28], due to the nature of the study it has aimed to determine, in detail, both direct and indirect costs, not overlooking micro costs [29, 30]. The direct cost increases in line with the clinical stage from IIB to IIIC2 (Table 3). However, at stage IVA there is a decrease because HDRBT is not used, due to an absence of suitable applicators at the institution. This trend is comparable to the study by Nguyen et al [31], which shows that in hospitals in central Vietnam, the medical costs for the treatment of CC increase as the cancer progresses to the later stages. In addition, Granados-Garcia et al [32] report that the medical cost for stages I–IV was between $4,738 and $6,058. In the study, RT represented 77% of the direct cost; this data was consistent with the study by Santos et al [33] of Brazilian women with CC regardless of the stage, RT and CT represented a cost of $1,491 and $1,069, respectively. Furthermore, our study shows that the direct cost is markedly reduced by starting irradiation with VMAT in clinical stage IIIC2, unlike the rest of the clinical stages, as starting the treatment with 3D only sequentially irradiates the pelvis and PA region, resulting in an increased
