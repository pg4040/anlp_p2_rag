the vertex cut. To estimate it, we select carbon events based on preselection criteria alone and calculate the efficiency of these events to pass the vertex cut in both flight data and carbon MC samples. However, the efficiency measured in flight data is influenced by the contribution of non-carbon background. To mitigate this bias, we subtract the background, estimated using template fits. We observe a discrepancy of up to 7% between the efficiency of the vertex cut in MC carbon and what is observed in flight data, see figure 9. We hypothesize that this significant uncertainty is, at least in part, a result of the inaccuracies in the hadronic model employed in our MC simulations. Further investigation and a more comprehensive study of this effect are necessary, see in particular [25, 26]. P o S ( I C R C 2 0 2 3 ) 1 6 8 5. Conclusions Figure 9: Top: efficiency of the vertex selection, measured on the flight data (black points) and carbon MC (crimson), as a function of deposited (BGO) energy. Bottom: ratio of efficiencies. The estimated vertex systematics is based on the deviation of this ratio from 1. In conclusion, the utilization of machine learning (ML) techniques in the DAMPE experiment has proven to be instrumental in various aspects of cosmic ray analysis. The ML tracking approach enables improved track reconstruction, facilitating the identification of carbon candidate events with reduced background contribution and maintaining high acceptance rates. Additionally, the ML models applied for BGO saturation correction enhance the energy resolution, particularly at high energies. The successful application of ML techniques highlights their significance in advancing our understanding of cosmic rays, offering valuable insights into the carbon flux and its implications for astrophysics research.
