densities. The infrared thermal images of each component sample under the same conditions are presented in Fig. 3B. Obviously, the temperature of Se@PDA-ICG changed signicantly with increasing irradiation time, which was in line with the temperature change curve. To assess the ability of Se@PDA-ICG to produce singly linear oxygen (1O2), DPBF was used as a uorescent probe. DPBF can react irreversibly with 1O2 and uorescence quenching occurred, resulting in a reduction in the UV absorption peak at 419 nm. The absorbance spectrum is shown in Fig. 3C, in which Se@PDA-ICG was incubated with DPBF under 808 nm laser irradiation. The characteristic absorption peak (419 nm) of Se@PDA-ICG gradually decreased with increasing irradiation time, indicating that Se@PDA-ICG could be triggered to effectively produce 1O2. Fig. 3D shows the variation in absorption at 419 nm with prolonged irradiation time of solutions containing different samples. The Se@PDA-ICG group exhibited themost effective ROS production, probably due to the more active molecular motion of ICG accompanied by the heating of Se@PDA. The above results indicated that the photothermal and photodynamic effects of Se@PDA-ICG were signicantly enhanced compared to those of free ICG and Se@PDA, indicating Fig. 4 In vitro antibacterial activity of Se@PDA-ICG.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry that Se@PDA-ICG has the potential to take on the role of a photoresponsive antimicrobial therapeutic agent. The antibacterial activity of Se@PDA-ICG was next assessed in vitro by plate counting with E. coli and S. aureus. PBS, Se@PDA, ICG, and Se@PDA-ICG were co-incubated with bacterial suspension for 2 h and then irradiated with the laser for 10 min (808 nm 1 W cm−2). We can see in Fig. 4A and B that aer the treatment of each group with E. coli, the survival rates of the Se@PDA, Se@PDA + NIR, ICG and ICG + NIR groups were 94.8%, 67.17%, 91.1% and 3.4%, indicating that Se@PDA and ICG can inhibit bacterial growth through photothermal and photodynamic effects, respectively. The survival rate of the Se@PDA-ICG group in the dark was 85.7%, however, that of the Se@PDA-ICG + NIR group was 0%. We could draw the conclusion that Se@PDA-ICG possessed excellent photothermal and photodynamic antibacterial effects compared with the other groups. Next,
