runs for each hold-out disease type and the hold-out patient set. Bar height is the group-averaged mean squared-error of the bootstrapaveraged network models. Error bars are the standard deviation over bootstraps of the group-averaged mean squarederror of the network models.

Organizing patients according to their network models reveals that tissue type is a primary178 driver, but not the sole factor in determining gene-gene interactions (Fig. 3). In particular, diseased networks dif-179 fer drastically from healthy networks, while gene and PCA-derived metagene expression profiles are still largely180 tissue-derived. Additionally, intra-disease (Fig. 5a) and inter-disease (Fig. 6a) subtypes are visible even at pan-cancer181 resolution (Fig. 3), making obvious common tumorigenesis mechanisms that underly noisy gene expression dynamics.182 Contextualized
