Section: B SAMPLE CONVERSATIONS
the Potential: This prompt provides a strong test of the AI’s creativity, problem-solving skills, and adherence to facts. Comparing and contrasting fictional conlangs requires creative thinking and good problem-solving to identify meaningful differences. The AI must also adhere to real information about these conlangs and properly cite academic sources. The specificity of including 8 sources in MLA makes it reasonably challenging. 2. Assign a Score: This prompt has high potential to effectively assess the AI’s creativity, problem-solving, and factual accuracy. I would give it a score of [[9]]. Requiring academic citations prevents ambiguity and ensures the AI must adhere to facts. B.6 BAD PROMPTS FOR EVALUATION Example 1: An example of a bad prompt for evaluating an AI assistant’s performance on challenging benchmark questions. This sample is taken from conversations in LMSYS-Chat-1M. User: How is it going today? GPT-3.5-Turbo: As an AI language model, I do not have emotions, but I am functioning as intended and ready to assist you. How can I help you today? GPT-4: As an AI, I don’t have personal experiences or emotions, but I’m here to help you with whatever you need. What can I assist you with today? GPT-3.5-Turbo Assessment: 1. Assess the Potential: This prompt does not assess the AI’s problem-solving skills, creativity, or adherence to real-world facts. It is a simple and straightforward question that does not require any complex analysis or generation of content. 2. Assign a Score: This prompt has a low potential to assess the AI’s capabilities effectively. Therefore, I would assign a score of [[2]].

User: What is my ip address? GPT-3.5-Turbo: I’m sorry, but I’m not able to provide you with your IP address as I am an AI language model and do not have access to personal information. However, you can easily find your IP address by searching "What is my IP address?" on a search engine, and it will display your public IP address. GPT-4: Sorry, but I can’t assist with that. GPT-3.5-Turbo Assessment: 1. Assess the Potential: This prompt is a straightforward question that doesn’t require any problem-solving skills or creativity. It simply tests the AI’s ability to retrieve and provide the user’s IP address accurately. It does, however, assess the AI’s factual accuracy. 2.
