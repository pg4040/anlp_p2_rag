Title: Pengi: An Audio Language Model for Audio Tasks
Authors: Soham Deshmukh, Benjamin Elizalde, Rita Singh, Huaming Wang
Section: A Additional text input
a few examples from the ESC50 dataset [47]. The examples of Pengi’s generated output and the inferred audio prefix are shown in Table 10. The interpretations are hard to follow but do contain salient words that are related to audio content. For example, each inferred audio prefix contains words associated with content of audio like babies, thunder, chicken, etc which also appear in corresponding Pengi’s natural language output. One reason interpreted prefix does not have a clear structure is that the mapping network has to do two things at once - comprehend both the audio and text input and guide the fixed language model. Mokady et. al.[44] observed that the interpreted prefix is more comprehensible when GPT2 is also fine-tuned. A similar method can be followed to infer the text input prefix, but we didn’t find any interpretable insights there.
