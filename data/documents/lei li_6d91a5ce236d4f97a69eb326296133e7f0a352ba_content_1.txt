different torques, which was then used to derive the KFTS curve. Based on the KFTS curve and the KTS curve obtained from the proposed model in this paper, the theoretical KWTS curve of the harmonic drive can be obtained. Figure 10 illustrates a comparison between the theoretical KWTS curve and the experimental KWTS curve. It can be observed from Figure 10 that the trend of the theoretical and experimental harmonic drive torsional stiffness curves with respect to torque variation is extremely consistent. The maximum error between the experimental and theoretical values of the harmonic drive torsional stiffness occurs at 0.5Nm, where the theoretical torsional stiffness is 2524.92Nm/rad and the experimental torsional stiffness is 2723.75Nm/rad, with a relative FIGURE 10 Comparison between experimental and theoretical torsional stiffness of harmonic drive under different torques. error of 7.30%. This result demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed model.
