808 nmNIR irradiation. Fig. 3A shows graphs of the photothermal warming data for Se NPs, Se@PDA and Se@PDA-ICG at a concentration of 200 mg mL−1 aer irradiation with an 808 nm NIR laser at a power density of 2 W cm−2 for 10 min. More broadly, a change in the temperature of the Se NPs alone was not evident, the temperature of Se@PDA RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 9998–10004 | 9999 Fig. 2 Photothermal properties of Se@PDA. (A) Photothermal heating curves of different concentrations of Se@PDA (808 nm, 2.0 W cm−2). (B) Temperature evolution curve of Se@PDA (200 mg mL−1) solution under different NIR irradiation intensification. (C) Heating and cooling cycles at Se@PDA. (D) Cooling curve of Se@PDA. Fig. 3 The photothermal heating effect of Se@PDA-ICG and the effect of generating 1O2. (A and B) Se@PDA-ICG photothermal heating curves and infrared thermal images under NIR irradiation (808 nm, 2.0 W cm−2). (C) Absorption spectra of DPBF and Se@PDA-ICG at different times under 808 nm irradiation.
