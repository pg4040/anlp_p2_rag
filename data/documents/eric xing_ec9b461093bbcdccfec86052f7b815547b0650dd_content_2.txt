Section: 2. Energy resolved polarization analysis with the POLAR data
only 3 polarization parameters are used since the energy break is fixed. The resulting "corner plots" for both cases, showing the posterior distributions of each parameter against each other, are shown in Figure 3.

The three PD values are compatible with each other for all the GRBs, the PD posterior distribution for the energy integrated case being slightly more constrained due to higher statistics, since the events in the case of the PD Heaviside fit are split into 2 energy bins. b) Energy break for the Heaviside fit on the PD. For most of the GRBs it is poorly constrained except at very low energies below 100 keV c) Polarization angle in the case of an Heaviside PD fit and in the energy integrated case. The PA for both cases are compatible for all GRBs of the catalog.

The polarization angle is very similar in the three cases. In the case where the energy break is free, we can see that the position of the break is poorly constrained, so as the PD at high energy, while the PD at low
