Bardwell, a master builder. Construction was completed in 1840. Located adjacent to the University of West Alabama, Julia Strudwick Tutwiler, a Lake relative, periodically resided in the house from 1881 to 1910 while she served as president of the university. It was then known as Livingston Normal College. The house was extensively photographed by Alex Bush for the Historic American Buildings Survey in November and December 1936. Lakewood has continued to be owned by descendants of the Lake family to the current day. The house and its surviving 10 acres (4.0 ha) of grounds were listed on the Places in Peril in 2012 due to the immediate threat of its acquisition by developers.
