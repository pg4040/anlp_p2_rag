effects of longer pretraining and larger models on social bias, by establishing the correlation of these variables in Figure 1. Here we can observe that as the model size increases so does the LM model score and social bias across the SS dataset. Moreover, later stages of pretraining have a higher LM model score, where the social bias score tends to be high. The application of dynamic PTQ shows a regularizer effect on all models.The Kendall Tau C across the models and categories shows a strong correlation between LM score and social bias. Statistical significant tests were performed using a one-sided t-test to evaluate the positive correlation. Tables 2 and 3 show at what step, out of the 21 we tested, the best LM scores occur on the SS dataset. In Table 2 the best LM score increases monotonically with model size and so do the social biases. Interestingly, as the model size increases the best LM score appears after around 80% of the pretraining. In opposition, in Table 3, with dynamic PTQ the best LM score occurs around 20% of the pretraining and maintains the trend of higher LM score and social bias, albeit at lower scores than the original models. This shows an interesting possibility of early stopping depending on the deployment task of the LLM.
