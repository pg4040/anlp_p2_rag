appear (Supplementary information, Fig. S1). Since the lattice structure of the 1/1 AC has the inversion symmetry (see Fig. 1B), the emergence of the nonreciprocal dispersion is ascribed to the alignment of the magnetic moments in the hedgehog state (see Fig. 1A). This point will be discussed in detail in the section of analysis of nonreciprocal excitation below. Magnetic dynamical structure factor. Next, we calculate the magnetic dynamical structure factor defined by where |GS� is the ground state with the energy E0 and Sqα is the Fourier transformation of the “spin” operator defined by Sqα = 1√N ∑N i=1 e −iq·ri Siα . We set η = 10−3 . The intensity of inelastic neutron scattering is expressed by the dynamical structure factor where q is the incident wavevector and q̂α ≡ qα/|q|38. The results of S⊥(q,ω) for q along the symmetry line in the bcc unit cell illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3 are shown in Fig. 4A. Notable is that the high intensities appear in the high-energy branches, especially along the Ŵ -H line and the P-Ŵ -N line. In the upper branches, the relatively high and moderate intensities appear. This is in sharp contrast to the case in the collinear FM order in the 1/1 AC where high intensity in Sxx(q,ω) and Syy(q,ω) appears continuously from the Ŵ point in the magnon branch with the lowest excitation energy (Supplementary information, Fig. S3). In Fig. 4, the remarkable intensity appears for q along the N-P-Ŵ line where the nonreciprocal dispersion ωm′(q) �= ωm′(−q) appears (see Fig. 3). In the QC, the dynamical structure factor was calculated in Ref.18 where the high intensity appears around the Ŵ point in the high energy region. The high intensities of S⊥(q,ω) around the Ŵ point, i.e., along the Ŵ -H line as well as the P-Ŵ -N line shown in Fig. 4A capture this feature. Figure 4B shows the intensity plots of S⊥(−q,ω) for the same q presented in Fig. 4A. By comparing Fig. 4B with Fig. 4A, we see that the nonreciprocity can be detected as the differences in the intensities of S⊥(−q,ω) and S⊥(q,ω) for q along the N-P-Ŵ line. Namely, the nonreciprocal dispersion is remarkable by the intensity differences of the dynamical structure factors in the upper and lower branches.
