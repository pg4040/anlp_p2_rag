Section: Appendix: The difference between the SchwarzschildMOG metric and the Reissner–Nordström metric
According to the literature [71], we assume that the BH charge Q is proportional to the BH mass in the form Q =√ αGNM . The Schwarzschild-MOG metric potential Eq.(3) is therefore rewritten as f (r) = 1 − 2GM rc2 + GQ 2 r2c4 , (38) and we obtain a line element ds2 = − ( 1 − 2GM rc2 + GQ 2 r2c4 ) dt2 + dr 2 1 − 2GM rc2 + GQ2 r2c4 + r2dΩ2. (39) Evidently, the above metric has a similar form to that of the RN solution [84], ds2 = − ( 1 − 2GNM rc2 + GNQ 2 r2c4 ) dt2 + dr 2 1 − 2GNM rc2 + GNQ2 r2c4 + r2dΩ2. (40) However, it’s important to note that the gravitational constant in metric (39) is an enhanced one, G = (1 + α)GN, rather than Newton’s constant GN in Eq. (40). Therefore, the Schwarzschild-MOG solution and RN solution are substantially different, although some mathematical operations can transform the former into a form similar to that of the latter. By analyzing the strength of the gravitational field, we can further unveil the differences between the SchwarzschildMOG BH and the RN BH. As we know, the gravitational force Ψ is the first-order partial derivative of gtt with respect to radius r , namely, Ψ = −∂ f (r)/∂r . Figure 16 shows the variation relationship between the gravitational force Ψ and radius r for the Schwarzschild-MOG BHs (solid line) and the RN BHs (dashed line). We find that an increase in gravity coupling parameter α significantly enhances the attractive force of the Schwarzschild-MOG BH to matter, while the charge Q has a negative effect on the gravitational field of the RN BH. It is also found that the gravitational strength of Schwarzschild-MOG BHs is always greater than that of RN BHs when α > 0. This implies that they differ in their optical appearance and can be distinguished by their images. We focus on this issue in the main text.
