Section: 3.2. The Proposed Fairness Adaptation Approach
segmentation maps is highly dependent on the window size used in Markovian approaches (the number of neighbor pixels being selected). In our work, to sufficiently capture the conditional structural constraint, instead of modeling only neighborhood dependencies as Markovian approaches, we generalize it by modeling ps(y \k s |yks ) via a conditional structure network (detailed in Sec. 4) to consider the correlation between all pixels in the segmentation. Relaxation of Ideal Data Distribution One of the key challenging problems in optimizing Eqn. (8) is that the conditional ideal data distributions p′s(y \k s |yks ) and p′s(y \k t |ykt ) are not available. Therefore, instead of directly optimizing these terms, let us consider the tight bound as in Eqn. (9). Exs∼ps(xs) log ( p′s(y \k s |yks ) ps(y \k s |yks ) ) + Ext∼pt(xt) log ( p′s(y \k t |ykt ) ps(y \k t |ykt ) ) ≤ − [ Exs∼ps(xs) log ps(y \k s |yks ) + Ext∼pt(xt) log ps(y \k t |y k t ) ] (9) With any form of ideal distribution p′s(·), Eqn. (9) always hold due to log p′s(·) ≤ 0. Hence, optimizing Eqn. (9) also ensure the conditional structural constraint in Eqn. (8) imposed due to the upper bound of Eqn. (9). Therefore, the demand for ideal data distribution is relaxed. Fig. 3 illustrates our proposed fairness domain adaptation framework.
