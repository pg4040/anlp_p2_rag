Section: Checklist
the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)? [Yes] The URL to code is provided in Section 1. (b) Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)? [Yes] We use the standard data splits for evaluation with the WMT14 DE-EN dataset. We do not perform model training in this work. (c) Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)? [No] We do not perform training, so there are no averages over random seeds. As discussed in Section 3, we found in preliminary experiments that there was little variation in efficiency measures across runs, so we run each evaluation setting only once. (d) Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)? [Yes] Reported or computable from results reported in Section 3. 4. If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets... (a) If your work uses existing assets, did you cite the creators? [Yes] See Section 3. (b) Did you mention the license of the assets? [No] The license of the WMT14 DE-EN dataset is not listed on the dataset website. However, data is sourced from the EuroParl corpus with no listed copyright restrictions.8 (c) Did you include any new assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL? [No] (d) Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data youâ€™re using/curating? [No] We use WMT14 DE-EN, a popular long-standing corpus of parallel translation data. The curators of this dataset do not report this information. (e) Did you discuss whether the data you are using/curating contains personally identifiable information or offensive content? [No] We use WMT14 DE-EN, a popular longstanding corpus of parallel translation data. The curators of this dataset do not report this information. 5. If you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects... (a) Did you include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable? [N/A] (b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable? [N/A] (c) Did you include the estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation? [N/A] 8For more information see the WMT-14 Task https://www.statmt.org/wmt14/translation-task. html and the EuroParl Corpus https://www.statmt.org/europarl/
