to align with global ones using a shared codebook and not updating it after local LSD. With the local calibration scheme, the audio representation is learned more robustly with long-term information, gaining 1.5 in J&F and 2.1 in mIoU (as is shown in Row 5). Ablation on codebook size, semantic token number, frame number, and input resolution are in the Appendix.
