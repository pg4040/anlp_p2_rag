5. Reinforcing Hannibal’s army: Hannibal achieved several stunning victories against Rome, such as the Battle of Cannae. However, he lacked the resources and reinforcements needed to capitalize on these victories. Carthage could have focused on sending more troops and resources to support Hannibal’s campaign in Italy, potentially allowing him to defeat Rome decisively. ... GPT-3.5-Turbo Assessment: 1. Assess the Potential: This prompt is a good test of the AI’s problem-solving skills and its knowledge of historical events. The AI would need to analyze the historical context of the Second Punic War and propose alternative choices that Carthage could have made to increase their chances of winning. This requires critical thinking and a deep understanding of the subject matter. 2. Assign a Score: This prompt has a high potential to assess the AI’s problem-solving skills and knowledge of historical facts. It requires the AI to think analytically and propose alternative strategies. Therefore, I would assign a score of [[9]]. Arena User Vote: GPT-4 is better. Here, GPT-4 has a better answer to the user’s question by supplying more facts and reasons in greater details, such as mentioning General Hannibal. Further, GPT-4 replied with a total of 10 alternative choices in the full response. Example 2: An example of a good prompt for evaluating an AI assistant’s performance on challenging benchmark questions. This sample is taken from conversations in LMSYS-Chat-1M. User: I currently have 4000 apples and 2500 oranges. I’ll be buying some more fruit, and I want to have an equal 50/50 ratio of apples to oranges. If I’m going to buy exactly 4500 pieces of fruit on top of what I started with, how many apples should I buy and how many oranges should I buy? Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. GPT-3.5-Turbo: Great! Let’s start by finding the total number of apples and oranges you want to have after buying the additional fruit. To have a 50/50 ratio of apples to oranges, we need to have an equal number of each. Since we currently have 4000 apples and 2500 oranges, we need to add the same number of each to reach a total of 8500 pieces of fruit. So, we need to add (8500 - 4000 - 2500) = 2000 more pieces of each fruit. Now, let’s find out how many apples and oranges you should buy to get the desired ratio. Since we want to have an equal number of apples and oranges, we can divide
