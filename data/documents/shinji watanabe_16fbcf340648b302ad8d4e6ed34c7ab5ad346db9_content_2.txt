λ, so as to discourage long tokens while encouraging faster emission of tokens if latency is a concern. D.3. Effect of Input Sequence length on Duration Prediction In Section D.1, we note that the large ratio of input sequence to target sequence TU was important to the emission of tokens with long durations, and that with a smaller ratio, the model would emit shorter duration tokens, even if it supported a large duration set (Nd = 8). In the following section, we attempt to analyze such a scenario, using different input sequence lengths (T = {20, 40, 70, 100}) while maintaining the target sequence length of U = 10. This enables us to analyze the effect of modifying the ratio TU . Note that as a result of changing T , JS is effectively a different sampled Joint tensor (represented as JST ), however, the target sequence U remains the same. In Fig. 9, we observe the alignments as we modify T . Of particular note is that when the ratio TU is small, tokens with short duration are preferred, performing nearly all token emissions without significant delay, and only towards the end does it emit a d ∈ {6, 8} duration token. On the other hand, when the ratio TU is large, tokens with long duration are preferred (with a large number of tokens having duration d = 8), and with a significant delay of token emission (note that FastEmit has not been enabled here). In Figure 10, we see that increasing the FastEmit strength (λ) provides a corresponding decrease in token latency, even for large differences in sequence lengths.
