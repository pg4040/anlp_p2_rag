to the fact that increasing the parameter α makes the Schwarzschild-MOG BH’s gravitational effect stronger, resulting in an increase in the deflection angle of the light. In other words, the Schwarzschild-MOG BH with a larger parameter α is capable of bending the light with a larger impact parameter and making it intersect the stable circular orbit we considered. Figure 4 also shows that the observed direct and secondary images depend closely on the inclination angle. More specifically, the direct image is deformed into a hat-shaped when an observer views along the edge-on orientation. This is because the light rays emitted from the disk elements blocked by the BH can be scattered to the upper region of the BH by gravitational lensing. In addition, the range of the photon deflection angle is 5π/2−ω ≤ ϕ ≤ 5π/2+ω for k = 2, which implies that when the observation angle ω takes a larger value, there exist some light rays with smaller deflection angles that can contribute to the secondary images with a deviation from circularity. This reveals why the deviations from the circularity of secondary images become significant as the inclination angle increases. 3.2 Redshift factor The redshift factor g has an essential influence on the observed energy flux of the accretion disk, which can be expressed as g = 1 + z = Ee Eo , (30) in which z denotes the redshift, Ee and Eo correspond to the projections of the photon’s four-momentum kμ on the fourvelocity of the disk elements pμs and the distant observer p μ o , 2 rms = 6 for α = 0, 7.33 for α = 0.3, and 9.91 for α = 0.9, respectively. These values are obtained by Eq. (12). respectively. In the rest frame of the emitting light source, Ee is read as [41,44–46] Ee = kμ pμs = kt pts ( 1 + Ω kϕ kt ) . (31) Note that the ratio kϕ/kt is invariant along the photon path and it is related to the impact parameter b by kϕ/kt = b sin ω cos η according to the geometry introduced in Fig. 2 [41,44–46]. Hence, we have Ee = kt pts (1 + Ωb sin ω cos η) . (32) For a static distant observer with the four-velocity pμo = (1, 0, 0, 0), the projection of the photon’s four-momentum on his four-velocity is Eo = kμ pμo = kt . (33) By combining Eqs. (30), (32), and (33), we arrange the redshift factor as g = 1 +
