Preliminary (b) Figure 5: Preliminary DAMPE Li/B (Fig. 5a), Be/B (Fig. 5b) ratios with statistical error (red) and a preliminary estimation of the systematic uncertainties plotted with results from AMS-02 [1]. Gray error bars represent the sum in quadrature of the statistical and systematic contributions. A preliminary look at Li/B and Be/B ratios is shown in Fig. 5 from 14.7 GeV/n to 3.2 TeV/n with a preliminary estimation of the systematic uncertainties. The kinetic energy per nucleon was computed assuming n(Li) = 6.5 and n(Be) = 8. The analysis of the spectra of lithium and beryllium and their ratios is still ongoing, focusing on further reduction of the background and a complete evaluation of the systematic uncertainties.
