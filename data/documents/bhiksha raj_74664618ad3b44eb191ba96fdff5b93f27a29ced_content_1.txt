maps eccentricity (see equation 1 to standard deviation, and measure the impact on accuracy on clean as well as adversarially perturbed data. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 14. We see that, as expected, increasing the scale of the noise improves accuracy on adversarially perturbed data, however, this improvement does not significantly degrade clean accuracy. It appears that the adaptive blurring is mitigating the deleterious impact of Gaussian noise on clean accuracy. On the other hand, increasing Î² beyond 0.01 surprisingly does not have a significant impact on accuracy and robustness. We also measured the accuracy on clean and perturbed data after varying the viewing distance (see 2.4) and the number of fixation points over which the logits are aggregated. These results are plotted in Figure 15, and they show that accuracy on clean and perturbed data is maximized when the width of the in-focus region is 48 (this corresponds to vd = 3) and aggregating over more fixation points improves accuracy on clean and perturbed data.
