of the non-collinear alignment of the magnetic moments. The excitation energy ε(q) is obtained by diagonalizing the matrix describing the propagation of |5�i among the |6�j states on all the j( = i) th sites where i and j denote the Tb sites inside the primitive unit cell of the bcc lattice. Let us focus on the excited state at the i = 1 st site |5�1 illustrated as the precession of the blue arrow in Fig. 5C. This state propagates to the neighboring j = 2 nd site (see the yellow arrow in Fig. 5C), which is expressed by the matrix element Here, r1 = d(1, τ , 0) and r2 = d(0, 1, τ) are used. On the other hand, the matrix element between the spatially inverted sites i = 12 and j = 10 (see the yellow arrow in Fig. 5D) is calculated by Eq. (14) as Here, r12 = d(−1,−τ , 0) and r10 = d(0,−1,−τ) are used. The sign in the iτ term in Eqs. (16) and (17) are opposite, which signals the nonreciprocal excitation. This can be understood by taking the superposition of Eq. (16) and its spatially inverted term Eq. (17) as done in Eq. (13) The cos term is even function in terms of q , while the sin term is odd function giving rise to the nonreciprocal contribution. Namely, the sign change occurs when q is replaced with −q in the sin term, which is in sharp contrast to the collinear FM case in Eq. (13). The sin term also emerges for the other N.N. sites of j = 4, 5 , and 6 to the i = 1 st site and their spatially inverted sites except for the j = 3 rd site (Supplementary information, Section IV). By diagonalizing Hi,j(q) in Eq. (15), the excitation energy εm′(q) is obtained. Figure 6A shows the lowest excitation energy ε1(q) in the h-k plane at l = 0 for q = 2πa (h, k, l) . The result shows ε1(qx , qy , 0) = ε1(−qx ,−qy , 0) indicating that the reciprocal excitation appears in the qx-qy plane at qz = 0 . This explains the result shown in Fig. 3 where ωm′(q) = ωm′(−q) holds along the Ŵ-H-N line and the Ŵ -N line. We have also calculated ε1(q) in the k-l plane at h = 0 and in the l-h plane at k = 0 . The result is the same as Fig. 6A with h and k being replaced
