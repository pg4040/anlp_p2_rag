English, using human translations and our in-house machine translation system to convert English datasets into Arabic for the purposes of evaluation. Evaluating only on knowledge [HBB+22, LZK+23] and commonsense reasoning [ZHB+19, SBBC21] based on the evaluation settings of prior work [TLI+23, MWS+23] is arguably not a holistic evaluation, as they are multiple-choice questions. To evaluate the generated text as a whole, human evaluation remains crucial. Unfortunately, it is both resource-intensive and sometimes exhibits variable quality, especially when using crowd-sourcing. Recent studies [ToÌˆr23, LXA23, GRS+23, WA23] have even suggested that ChatGPT annotation surpasses the performance of Amazon crowd-sourced workers, underscoring the importance of expert workers in the evaluation process. Expanding upon these findings, another study [PLH+23, CLL+23] used GPT-4 as a substitute for crowd-sourced workers to compare two model outputs. This is achieved by presenting an evaluation prompt and providing both model outputs as a context for the assessment.
