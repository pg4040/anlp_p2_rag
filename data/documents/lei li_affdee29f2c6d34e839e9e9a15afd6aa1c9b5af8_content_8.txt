Se@PDA-ICG + NIR group was the highest, and the CD45 antigen was the least. These results demonstrate that Se@PDA-ICG + NIR can promote new angiogenesis, reduce cellular inammation and accelerate wound healing. At the end of the treatment, the stained section images of the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of the experimental groups showed no signicant abnormalities compared with the control groups, indicating that the photoresponse treatment was non-invasive to the internal organs with insignicant side effects (Fig. S12Câ€ ). In summary, the photosensitizer ICG was loaded onto PDAfunctionalized Se NPs to create a photoresponsive therapeutic antibacterial platform. The Se@PDA-ICG platform can rapidly kill bacteria under 808 nm NIR irradiation. More excitingly, Se@PDA-ICG could rapidly remove infected bacteria from wounds in vivo and promote wound healing without toxic effects. Thus, the Se@PDA-ICG photoresponsive nanoplatform developed in this study could provide a new material or strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.
