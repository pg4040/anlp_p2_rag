Section: 6. Conclusion
Our results, along with those of Ref. [6], present the first measurement by DAMPE of inelastic hadronic cross sections. ML techniques were used, first to construct a pure sample of proton and helium events, and then to identify the interaction vertex of those events. By measuring the cross P o S ( I C R C 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 2 section of proton, which is well constrained, we demonstrated the validity of our method. In the case of helium, our analysis presents the first measurement of the BGO cross section at the considered energies. We found that while the measured cross section initially agrees with Geant4, an increase is observed of about ∼ 10% above 1 TeV.
