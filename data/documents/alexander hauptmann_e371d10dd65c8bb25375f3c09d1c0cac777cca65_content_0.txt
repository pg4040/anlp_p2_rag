Title: Hyperbolic vs Euclidean Embeddings in Few-Shot Learning: Two Sides of the Same Coin
Authors: Gabriel Moreira, Manuel Marques, Alexander Hauptmann
Section: 7. Conclusion
In this paper we set out to demonstrate that, contrary to widespread belief, hyperbolic embeddings are not necessarily better than Euclidean ones in few-shot learning. We showed that, in high-dimensional Poincaré balls, embeddings tend to saturate at the effective boundary. Consequently, the hierarchy-encoding property of hyperbolic space is lost and, in this situation, whatever accuracy hyperbolic few-shot classifiers have, can be ascribed to the angular separation of their representations. Based on this, we presented empirical results demonstrating that hyperbolic performance on two popular few-shot learning tasks can actually be matched and even improved upon via traditional Euclidean encoders with fixed-radius embeddings. We believe this work can open up new research directions on the design of more effective benchmarks for hyperbolic embeddings, as well as on the identification of computer vision applications wherein hyperbolic geometry presents an unambiguous advantage over Euclidean space.
