Title: Antimicrobial properties of heterojunction BiSnSbO6-ZnO composites in wastewater treatment
Authors: Jing Chen, Shichuan Zhang
Section: 
free radical scavenging experiment, SEM observation of the morphological changes of the bacteria after light treatment and analysis of the energy band structure, the prepared BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material can Page 13/31 generate active species ·OH, h+ and e− through light irradiation to achieve the purpose of sterilization, where e− Play the main role. Cytotoxicity experiments proved that the prepared BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material was non-toxic at the experimental concentration, indicating that the BiSnSbO6ZnO composite photocatalytic material was a green, safe and e cient photocatalytic material with broad-spectrum antibacterial properties and species differences.
