All metabolites Total metabolites identified in Schelli et al. study Schelli et al. (2017) Common metabolites identified in Schelli et al. versus our study Total metabolites identified in our study Common metabolites identified in Ammons et al. versus our study Total metabolites identified in Ammons et al. study Ammons et al. (2014) 137 19 163 26 120 AMR associated metabolites 20 16 69 19 26 FIGURE 5 Venn diagrams representing a comparison of metabolites identified from our study versus previously published studies in the domain. In study-1 (Ammons et al.), 26 metabolites were found to be common in total metabolites and 19 metabolites were common in AMR-associated metabolites with our study. In study-2 (Schelli et al.), 19 metabolites were found to be common in total metabolites and 16 metabolites were common in AMRassociated metabolites with our study.
