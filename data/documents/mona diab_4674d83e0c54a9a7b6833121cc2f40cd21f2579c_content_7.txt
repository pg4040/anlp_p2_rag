Section: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
mRNA down expression in tumoral samples compared to normal samples in rectal, colon, colorectal adenocarcinomas and cervical cancer respectively. This downregulation is pronounced in all pathological stages (Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, Stage IV) and TNM stages, as early as stage I and T stage. The box plots represent the mean of Log2 RSEM ± SEM. The RNA Seq database analysis was carried out by PAST software. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (ratio ± SEM for PAMR1/HSPA8) at transcriptomic level of three different sets of tissue samples classified by T stages (T1, T2, T3) of TNM classification. (B) Western blot analysis for PAMR1 expression in tumoral tissues from patients compared to their adjacent normal ones in the four CRC pathological stages. N: Normal. T: Tumoral. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. downregulated in colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT29, and SW620), compared to normal colon CCD841CoN cells. Similarly, to CRC cell lines, cervical cancer HeLa cells also exhibited very low PAMR1 expression with high CT values around 36 (normal cervix cell lines not available).
