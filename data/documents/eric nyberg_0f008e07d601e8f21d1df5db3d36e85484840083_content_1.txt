Section: 7 Conclusion
given question more than one correct answer is possible. In such cases, a rewrite of the question, for the purpose of clarifying its interpretation, might be beneficial (Min et al., 2020). In GameQA, this would require an additional task in the question review step (see Section 5.2). Ethics Statement The data collection process in GameQA consists of collecting paragraphs, from a set of sources/domains (see Section 5), in which answers can be found to given questions. Before starting our RUQuAD corpus collection process, we obtained formal permissions from The Icelandic Web of Science, the news cites mbl.is and visir.is, and the Icelandic Government Information website, to freely include paragraphs from their sources in our corpus. For the last domain, the Icelandic Wikipedia, formal permission was not needed because its material is already freely licensed. As a part of the data collection, we did not collect any information about the users aside from their email address which was necessary to verify an account after registration. The data collection was GDPR compliant and we offered to remove any annotations or datapoints belonging to a users should they request that. However, no user made such a request. As discussed in Section 4, GameQA is a game open to any user in a particular geographic area and does not compensate crowd-workers financially.
