Section: G More Visualization
In this section, we demonstrate more visualization of PaintSeg. We show more qualitative results with box prompt in Fig. D, with point prompt in Fig. E and with coarse mask prompt in Figs. F and G. Figure D: More visualization of PaintSeg with box prompt on COCO MVal. Figure E: More visualization of PaintSeg with point prompt. The point prompt is illustrated by the red point on the image on DAVIS and Berkeley and GrabCut. Prompt PromptMask Mask Figure F: More visualization of PaintSeg with coarse mask prompt on ECSSD.
