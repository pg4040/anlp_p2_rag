of subjective health and social functioning, using the SF-36. The scoring of the subjects, based on the national standard score of the SF-36 at baseline (26), showed that all scores were above 50 points. There were significant increases in PF, GH, VT, and MCS in all MCTs supplement groups at week 12, compared to the control. MH also increased significantly in Decanoic acid supplement and Low-dose octanoic acid supplement groups. On the other hand, there were no significant changes in RP or BP, and there was no change in PCS, a summary score of physical health. The results indicated that the biggest effects of this intervention were in improving the mental aspect of QOL among the mental, physical, and social aspects of health. It also suggested improvements in PF, GH, and VT, which are subscales of PCS, and in GH, which is a subscale of RCS. Therefore, MCTs intake and walking have been shown to potentially improve mental aspects of QOL in middle-aged and older adults with no exercise habits and low BMIs. Previous studies have shown a correlation between physical activity and HRQOL scores (29, 30). A study of healthy individuals aged 60–89 years in the U.S. reported higher HRQOL scores in the group that engaged in more than one hour of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, compared with the group that engaged in less than one hour per week (30).
