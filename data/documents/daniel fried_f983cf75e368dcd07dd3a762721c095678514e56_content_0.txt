Section: B Brief Description of Diplomacy
Diplomacy is a seven player board game, where each player controls one of the seven European powers (Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey) and competes to control the majority of supply centres in Europe starting in the year 1901. The board is a map of Europe that is divided into 75 regions (split across land, water and coastal regions), 34 of which are supply centres (SCs). There are two types of units in the game: fleets, that can occupy water and coastal regions and armies, that can occupy land and coastal regions. Every power starts with 3 units and control 3 SCs, while Russia starts with 4 units and 4 SCs. As players control more SCs, they can build new units and when they lose SCs, they have to disband them. The game is split into years and each year con- tains multiple phases. The players privately issue commands for each unit they own at the end of each phase and these orders are then simultaneously revealed. Between phases, the players are allowed to communicate with other players in order to negotiate and coordinate their actions. This aspect is crucial, as the game is specifically designed so that a player is unlikely to achieve victory without the support from other players. A player wins the game by controlling 18 SCs. However, a game may also end in draw on any turn if all remaining players agree. When a player is in the lead, it is common for the remaining players to cooperate in order to prevent that player from winning the game and forcing a draw. See (Paquette et al., 2019; Kuliukas, 2011) for a more detailed description of the game.
