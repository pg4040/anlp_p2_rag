cutoff are shown in the right panel. The DAMPE upper limit (red dot) is lower than those from AMS-01 [11] (light red cross) and BESS [12] (red inverted triangle). The results of the underground experiments such as LSD [6] (blue triangles), Kamiokande II [5] (blue full diamond), MACRO [7] (blue dashed line), CDMS II [9] (blue dotted line), and MAJORANA [10] (blue solid line) are shown also. Table 2: The comparison between DAMPE and other similar types experiments [20]. Experiments Geometric acceptance(cm2sr) Exposure time (s) Upper limit (cm−2sr−1s−1) AMS-01 3000 3.6 × 104 3.0 × 10−7 (95% C. L.) BESS 1500 3.2 × 105 4.5 × 10−7 (90% C. L.) DAMPE 3000 2.3 × 107 6.2 × 10−10 (90% C. L.) Table 2 presents the complete results and some vital parameters of DAMPE, compared with other similar experiments. Figure 6 shows the upper limits from other FCP searches. Among underground experiments, MACRO yields the most sensitive upper limit. The CDMS II and MAJORANA experiments have high degrees of sensitivity to small charges because of the lower thresholds of the respective detection systems. Among space equipment, AMS-01 has a large geometric acceptance [25], but a short exposure duration. BESS integrates data gathered over four flights to achieve a longer exposure time but its geometric acceptance is limited. DAMPE has the longest and continuous exposure time as well as relatively large geometric acceptance, and therefore it yields the most stringent FCP flux upper limit for space experiments, with an improvement of three orders of magnitude over previous work.
