realized in the 1/1 AC as metastable state although the true ground state is alternated hedgehog order as shown in Refs.16, 17. In this report, to get insight into the mechanism of the nonreciprocal magnetic excitation in the uniform hedgehog order found in the QC, we analyze the magnetic excitation in the “uniform” hedgehog state in the 1/1 AC by employing the metastable state (local minimum in the energy landscape) but not the true ground state. Static structure factor of magnetism. First, let us analyze the magnetic structure of the uniform hedgehog ground state in the 1/1 AC. The static structure factor of magnetism is defined as where N is the total number of the Tb sites. Let us rewrite the position vector of the Tb site as ri = Rj + r0m , where Rj denotes the position of the center of the IC and r0m denotes the position of the mth Tb site on the IC. The position vector of the IC Ri is expressed as where ni is an integer and ai is the basic translation vector of the bcc lattice a1 = a2 (−1, 1, 1) , a2 = a 2 (1,−1, 1) , and a3 = a2 (1, 1,−1) . Here, a is the lattice constant of the bcc unit cell (see Fig. 1B). The magnetic structure factor (Eq. 2) is derived to be expressed in the convolution form as where the structure factor of the lattice FL(q) and the magnetic structure factor on a single IC SIC(q) are given by respectively. Here, NL = N31 is the number of the primitive unit cell which contains the single IC i.e., 12 Tb sites (note that the box frame drawn in Fig. 1B denotes the expanded unit cell which contains two ICs, i.e., 24 Tb sites) and N = 12NL holds. The wave vector is given by where bi is the basic translation vector in the reciprocal lattice with b1 = 2πa (0, 1, 1) , b2 = 2π a (1, 0, 1) , and b3 = 2πa (1, 1, 0). We consider the periodic boundary condition along ai for i = 1, 2, and 3. Then, h̃ , k̃ , and l̃ are given by h̃ = m1N1 , k̃ = m2N1 , and l̃ = m3 N1 with integer mi (i = 1, 2, 3) . The structure factor of the bcc lattice of the 1/1 AC is calculated as (1)H = ∑ �i,j� JijSi · Sj − D ∑ i (Si · êi3)2,
