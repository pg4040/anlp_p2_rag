Section: 5. Summary
Based on on-orbit data obtained from DAMPE over a period of five years the results of the search for 23𝑒 FCPs in primary cosmic rays are as follows. No FCP signals are observed and a flux P o S ( I C R C 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 9 upper limit ofΦ < 6.2×10−10 cm−2sr−1s−1 is established at the 90% C. L. A precise measurement of the flux or a conservative flux upper limit is essential to construct and constrain the model of FCPs. Most of the previously performed underground experiments assumed that FCPs would exhibit long penetration paths, which, in turn, requires them to have energy exceeding a few hundred GeV. Given the effective energy threshold arising from the geometric cutoff, experiments in space can be used to detect FCPs with energy as low as a few GeV. DAMPE serves as a novel observation platform and enables a long-term, continuous search for relatively low-energy FCPs in primary cosmic rays. In the future, with the accumulation of more on-orbit data, DAMPE is expected to perform even more sensitive FCP searches.
