Section: E.2 Toxicity & Quality Filtering Results
We also provide full results for our experiments with toxicity and quality filters, presented in Section 5. The evaluation results of the models with toxicity filters applied to their data are visualized in Figure 5 (left) and Figure 13, with full details in Table 14. The evaluation results of the models with quality filters applied to their data are visualized in Figure 5 (right) and detailed in Table 15.
