Section: 6. Conclusions and Limitations
This paper has presented the new fairness domain adaptation to semantic scene segmentation by analyzing the fairness treatment from class distributions. In particular, the conditional structural constraints have imposed the consistency of the predicted segmentation and modeled the structural information to improve the accuracy of segmentation models. Our ablation studies have analyzed different aspects affecting the fairness of segmentation models. It has also shown the effectiveness of our approach in terms of fairness improvement. Our FREDOM approach has achieved SOTA performance compared to prior methods. Limitations: One of the potential limitations in our approach is the computational cost of the conditional structural constraint LCond. As the constraint is computed by conditional structure network G, it requires more computational resources and time during training. Also, our work only utilized specific self-supervised loss, network backbones, and hyper-parameters to support our hypothesis. However, different aspects of learning have yet to be fully exploited, e.g., learning hyper-parameters, additional unsupervised loss Lt (adversarial loss, self-supervised loss). These could be further exploited in our future work.
