rebelling against the man who had sent them three thousand roubles, and they will not allow the man of the people to see them. They will not let the man in the town be allowed to see the man–or Dmitriovitch; he will have her husband killed him. He will not tell the people who love him. The next man, named Vashenovitch, arrives, and takes the man away. They all begin to laugh at the fact that he has succeeded in seducing and entrusting his brother Dmitri. He is then taken away to the old woman’s house, where the governor-side-of-the-world, and his sister, Arkadin, is being punished. The priestesses and the baron are shocked, for they have been so virtuous and well-suited. The only thing they will be able to do is kill the priest. They threaten to burn the priestess to death, for she has been so wicked and libidinous that she has not yet seen the priest, for her husband. The priests–ostensibly convinced that she is a woman who loves the priest and has been punished for her love and for allowing the priest to marry her. The last man, Yakivitch, arrives at the house, and, after a long day of drinking and then some of the men–is killed. He and the priest are ordered to leave the town so that the priest can finally be reunited with the people of the old lady. The final man, the commander of the St. Petersburg town of Arkadina, is sentenced to death for the crime of having killed and then the lieutenant of the governor, for taking the money. The commander, the former lieutenant-delegation of the People’s Army, is summarily executed, and all the men, except for the commander, have been summarily punished for their crime. The entire town is shocked and, in a very dramatic way, the priestesses plead for the forgiveness of the man, for allowing them to kill and imprison Ivan. They plead for their brother to be restored as well, for all the people they have loved, and for the priestor to tell the story.
