Title: Effect of instant surgery compared with traditional management on paediatric complicated acute appendicitis post‐surgery wound: A meta‐analysis
Year: 2023
Abstract: A meta‐analysis study to assess the influence of instant surgery (IS) compared with conservative therapy (CT) on paediatric complicated acute appendicitis (CAA) post‐surgery wounds. A comprehensive literature examination until January 2023 was implemented, and 2098 linked studies were appraised. The picked studies contained 66 674 subjects with paediatric CAA post‐surgery wounds in the picked studies' baseline; 64 643 of them were using IS, and 2031 were using CT. The odds ratio (OR) in addition to 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to calculate the consequence of the IS compared with the CT on paediatric CAA post‐surgery wounds using the dichotomous and continuous styles and a fixed or random model. The IS had a significantly higher wound infection (OR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.35–10.54, P < .001) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 57%) compared with the CT in a paediatric CAA post‐surgery wound. However, no significant difference was found between IS and CT in total antibiotic duration (MD, −5.34; 95% CI,−12.67 to −1.98, P = .15) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 95%) in paediatric CAA post‐surgery wounds. The IS had a significantly higher wound infection; however, no significant difference was found in total antibiotic duration compared with the CT in paediatric CAA post‐surgery wounds. Although precautions should be taken when commerce with the consequences because most of the studies picked for this meta‐analysis had low sample sizes.
