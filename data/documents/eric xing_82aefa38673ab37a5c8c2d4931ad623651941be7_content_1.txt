high-angular resolution up to 0.1 µas [81]. This hints at the possibility of employing Space-Earth VLBI to study BH photon rings through the visibility function in the future [81–83]. Based on the comparison of accretion disk images of Schwarzschild-MOG BH, Schwarzschild BH, and RN BH, we find that for fixed observational angle, BH mass, and accretion rate, the Schwarzschild-MOG BH with an arbitrary positive α exhibits the largest inner shadow and the lowest brightness. In contrast, the RN BH shows the smallest inner shadow and the largest luminosity. The size and luminosity of the Schwarzschild BH are somewhere between the other two BHs. These apparent differences provide potentially, qualitatively observational features to distinguish SchwarzschildMOG BH from the counterpart in standard General Relativity, as well as a window to probe scalar–tensor–vector modified gravity. In future work, we will study the emission spectrum of the thin accretion disk surrounding the Schwarzschild-MOG BH and its observed luminosity in different bands.
