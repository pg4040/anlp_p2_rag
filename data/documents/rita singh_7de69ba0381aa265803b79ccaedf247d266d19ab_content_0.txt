Section: CONCLUSION
The composite flour developed under the present research had superior nutritional quality since it contained a significant quantity of protein, energy, total dietary fibre, calcium and antioxidants as compared to wheat flour. The nutritional potential of the developed flour has been enhanced due to the incorporation of whole cow pea pod and barley husk. Barley husk too was found to be a good functional food with high fibre, ash and manganese content. Laminated aluminum pouches gave better results thus were found to be a better option for packaging. The study has established the use of the entire pod of cowpea and barley husk for Volume Issue 5 preparing a nutritionally enriched composite flour, that can be promoted as a healthy alternative for management of non-communicable diseases. Conflict of interest: None.
