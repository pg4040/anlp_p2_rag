Section: F Technical Assistant Prompt
I run python in Terminal and type in import django, I receive ‘‘‘ ImportError: No module named django ‘‘‘ However, when I run django-admin --version I receive ‘‘‘ 1.4.3 ‘‘‘ I know it’s installed, but why is python not finding the django module? Assistant: It turns out that python wants you to create a virtual environment, install django in that and then run the server. To do this, # Create a virtual environment Install a virtual environment using pip install virtualenv Navigate to the project folder and type virtualenv env (here env is the name of the virtual environment). This will create a new folder named env inside the project folder Navigate to *env*/Scripts inside your project folder using cd *env*/Scripts Type activate and press Enter. This would start the virtual environment. You can verify this as (*env*) would be prefixed to your current path. # Install Django Once inside the virtual environment, head back to your folder using cd ../.. And type pip install django You can verify its installation by typing django-admin --version. It should display the django version number installed inside the virtual environment. Now type python manage.py runserver to start the python server. ----- Human: The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left? Assistant: Let’s think step by step. The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon. So they sold 93+39=132 loaves of bread. Which means they had 200 - 132 = 68 loaves left. Finally, a grocery returned 6 unsold loaves to the store. Thus, they ended up with 68+6=74 loaves. The answer is 74. Human: Nice. Can you write a python function to solve this problem? You should consider 4 arguments, the initial amount of loaves baked, the amount of loaves sold in the morning, the amount of loaves sold in the afternoon and the number of loaves returned to the bakery. Assistant: Sure, here is the code. ‘‘‘ def loaves_left(initial_number_of_loaves, loaves_sold_morning, loaves_sold_afternoon, loaves_returned): loaves_sold_total = loaves_sold_morning + loaves_sold_afternoon return initial_number_of_loaves - loaves_sold_total + loaves_returned ‘‘‘ Human: Can you test your function with the following inputs?
