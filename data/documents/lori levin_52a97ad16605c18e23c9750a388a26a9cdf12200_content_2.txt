and sensation to the injured limb. Furthermore, the aesthetic and cosmetic aspects are of central concern for many patients (e.g., concerns about mismatched skin tone, body hair color/texture, and musculature/ size/bulk of transplanted limb). These issues are layered upon the body image concerns experienced by UE amputees and involve the singular experience of aesthetically integrating donor tissue in a highly visible body location (whereas most solid-organ transplants occur with internal/non-visible tissue). Hence, we have chosen to develop outcomes measures in the physical HRQOL area, including Hand Function, Aesthetics, and Sensation (both Function and Satisfaction with Sensation). The work in which we are engaged is designed to use stakeholder feedback to identify the appropriate domains for HRQOL assessment and to make the feedback actionable by developing items to measure these important stakeholderidentified areas. The definitions and theoretical structure described throughout this manuscript are critical to the development of items that can measure these areas of function. This marks one of the initial efforts to systematically develop new scales that focus directly on issues of critical importance to those who have undergone UE transplant, but which are absent from existing HRQOL measurement systems.
