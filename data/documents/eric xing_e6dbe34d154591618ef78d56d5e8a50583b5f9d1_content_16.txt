The context encoder, network archetypes, and contextualized network models are522 learned simultaneously using end-to-end backpropagation of the network loss (defined in Methods).523 Context Encoder & Training The context encoder is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron with 3 hidden layers,524 each 100 neurons wide with ReLU activations. The context data views (S2.2) are concatenated sample-wise to create525 a single context feature vector encompassing all views for each patient. We use a batch-size of 10 and our learning rate526 is chosen automatically using PyTorch Lightning’s auto-lr-find with an initial state of 1e-3. Model weights are527 initialized as Uniform[-0.01, 0.01]. We split our dataset into 80% training-validation and 20% testing. We528 create 30 bootstraps of the training-validation set and
