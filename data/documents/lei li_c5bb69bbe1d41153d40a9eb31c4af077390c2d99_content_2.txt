were all included in this metaanalysis. Regarding the setting and supporter of pharmaceutical interventions, the most common setting is primary healthcare team. Additionally, some interventions were provided at community or hospital pharmacies, in the form of pharmacists alone or in cooperation with a physician or nurse. In summary, the following steps involved pharmacists are the key to appropriate medications in older patients: patientsâ€™ evaluation and data collection, medication review, being agree with patients on treatment objectives, prescription decision, communication and obtaining patient agreement, medication dispensing, medication usage, monitoring and assessment (41, 54). Totally, 14 eligible RCTs were involved in the present study, which were mainly accompanied by a relatively high-quality. However, the limitations of this study were summarized as follows: (1) outcomes in the included studies varied, and only relatively few studies reported the same outcomes; (2) the data of the included studies were reported inconsistently, and thus, some outcomes could not be pooled; (3) only one study reported the cost of drugs; (4) difference in ethnicity, language, educational level, places for interventions and follow-up time among the subjects and studies all might influence the outcomes. (5) the possibility of missing studies not included in the databases we used and the articles published in other langue not being included in our analysis, (6) the risk of bias cannot be excluded, although most heterogeneity is acceptable. Therefore, more rigorously designed multi-center RCTs with larger sample size and longer follow-up with high-quality are needed to further validate the findings of the present study.
