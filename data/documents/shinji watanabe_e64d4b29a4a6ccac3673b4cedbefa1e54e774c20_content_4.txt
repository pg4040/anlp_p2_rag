Inter-laboratory variation in MN testing. (A) GMR of each sample MN titre compared to the global GMT of that sample across all testing laboratories. Geometric mean of GMRs and 95% CI are shown in black. Laboratories are colour coded and labelled along with protocol type on the x axis. The indicative interval of 0.8-1.25 is shaded in grey. Each laboratory has a unique number and colour in all graphical representation of data. (B) %GCV of each sample MN titre across the testing laboratories. Samples with a GMT <10 were excluded from analysis (shown as Xs in the figure). (C) %GCV of each sample MN titre plotted by subtype and lineage. Geometric mean of %GCV and 95% CI are shown in as black bars. frontiersin.org would have on identifying laboratory specific issues with serology testing, raising awareness of harmonized protocols for serology testing and raising awareness of the value of biological standards in reducing inter-laboratory variation.
