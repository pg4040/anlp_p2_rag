5). Compared to Cmin, AUC-guided dosing is preferable if conditions permit (Hanai et al., 2022), since AUC0-24/MIC is the recommended PK/PD index for such time-dependent antibiotics with long PAEs and responds to the overall exposure of teicoplanin. However, due to obstacles such as lack of practitioner familiarity, time allocation and training requirements, AUC-based dosing is unavailable in many clinical settings, in this case, Cmin may be recommended as a surrogate marker (Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore, the two indexes of Cmin and AUC0-24/MIC were both included in this study, and the results of each index were reported, for the selection and reference of clinical practitioners according to their own conditions. Though Cmin,72h on Day 4 before reaching steady state is recommended as a surrogate measure for teicoplanin TDM, the value is mainly an evaluation of the loading dose for the initial 3 days, therefore follow-up TDM such as Cmin, 240h is suggested to be conducted to evaluate the maintenance dose (Hanai et al., 2022). Taken together, optimal dosage regimens based on both Cmin and AUC0-24/MIC targets in this study are recommended in order to achieve both microorganism-nonspecific and microorganismspecific targets, which are 5 loading doses of 15 mg/kg (equates to approximately 1,000 mg) q12h followed by a maintenance dose of 15 mg/kg q24h for patients with a GFR of 90–120 mL/min/1.73 m2; 3 loading doses of 15 mg/kg (equates to approximately 1,000 mg) q12h followed by a maintenance dose of 15 mg/kg on Day 3 and 15 mg/kg q48h from Day 4 for patients with a GFR of 30–60 mL/ min/1.73 m2, and 3 loading doses of 12 mg/kg (equates to approximately 800 mg) q12h followed by a maintenance dose of 12 mg/kg on Day 3 and 12 mg/kg q72h from Day 4 for patients with a GFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Table 3). In addition, since the PTA and CFR results obtained from the simulated regimen in this study were not very satisfactory, the clinical efficacy of the recommended regimen should be verified by further real-world studies. Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10 To our knowledge, this is the first PPK model developed for teicoplanin in ICU adult patients with sepsis. Dosing regimens were optimized by four targets, including Cmin, AUC0-24/MIC, PTA and CFR, making it possible to compare the results directly from the above targets widely adopted in dose optimization and to understand the differences between them. The priority of the indicators and the limitation of Cmin,72h as a surrogate metric were also discussed. Monte Carlo simulations provided new information
