PIE dataset. Finally, we retain pairs where the optimized program is at least 5× faster and limit semantic duplicates to three, resulting in 1,485 optimized synthetic examples. This methodology aligns with self-play and self-instruct approachs in neural program synthesis (Haluptzok et al., 2022; Rozière et al., 2023). We provide additional details on the generation process in Appendix A.4.
