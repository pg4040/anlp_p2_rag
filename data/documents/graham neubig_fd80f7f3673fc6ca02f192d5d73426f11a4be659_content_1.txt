of spans produced by AUTOMQM, with UNICORN outperforming BISON at most metrics. Additionally, UNICORN prompted with AutoMQM predicts spans of comparable quality to the ones produced by current state-of-the-art learned wordlevel evaluators (trained on a considerable number of fine-grained annotations derived from MQM): while word-level models are more precise, their overall span correlation (MCC) is comparable, and they miss considerably more major errors than LLMs (despite only leveraging a handful of annotations).
