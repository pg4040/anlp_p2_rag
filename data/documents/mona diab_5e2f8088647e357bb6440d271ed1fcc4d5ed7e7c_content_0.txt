Section: 6 Conclusion
We utilize several pre-trained models for Task A in MEDIQA-Chat shared task. The main objective of this task is to develop clinical dialogue summarization in accordance with a classified section header for every dialogue. We fine-tuned different models for our experiments. Among the models 9https://huggingface.co/Amalq/ flan-t5-base-samsum-taskA we used, we found that Flan-T5, originally trained on dialogue datasets, outperformed other models that were trained on clinical data or summarization tasks. Specifically, Flan-T5 SAMSum outperformed all models except for summarization scores. It can also be concluded that summarization models trained on summarizing text, not dialogues, as in BioGPT, performed poorly on summarization tasks. In contrast, BART models performed better than the BioGPT model. Empirically, we found BioGPT to generate text that was not originally in the text, which is considered critical in the context of health records. Finally, since Flan-T5 SAMSum achieved the best results, we anticipate that further unsupervised training for the Flan-T5 language model with clinical dialogues would improve the results. Limitations Generating clinical notes or summaries of clinical conversations using NLP technology is a rapidly developing field with great potential. However, there are several limitations to this technology that must be considered. Firstly, NLP models rely on high-quality data to achieve accurate results. In the medical field, obtaining such data can be challenging due to privacy concerns and regulations. Secondly, the complex and technical nature of medical language poses a challenge to NLP models, which may struggle to understand and interpret medical terminology and abbreviations accurately. Additionally, clinical conversations often involve sensitive information that requires careful handling, making it important to ensure the security and privacy of generated clinical notes. This field is considered a safety critical area, where high precision is expected, therefore, the use of NLP models in such clinical settings must be performed with caution and under medical professionals’ supervision to ensure the generated notes’ accuracy and reliability. Ethics Statement When developing an automated system for clinical note generation from doctor-patient conversations, it is crucial to consider various ethical considerations. One such consideration is the privacy and confidentiality of patient information. The system must be designed to comply with regulations and guidelines for protecting patient data. Additionally, there must be explicit consent processes, ensuring that patients understand how their data will be used and allowing them to opt-out if desired. The system must also be developed fairly and transparent, ensuring it does not perpetuate biases or contribute to health disparities. Moreover, the system must be accurate and reliable, as errors or inaccuracies could lead to incorrect
