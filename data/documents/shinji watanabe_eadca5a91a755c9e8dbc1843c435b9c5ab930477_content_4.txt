. Then, the maximum appears at (h, k, l) = (±2.532,±4.098, 0) , (0,±2.532,±4.098) , and (±4.098, 0,±2.532) . Figure 2B shows SIC(q) in the h-k plane at l = 0 . We note that the analytic form of SIC(q) for q = 2πa (h, k, 0) can be derived as We have also calculated SIC(q) for q = 2πa (h, 0, l) in the l-h plane at k = 0 and SIC(q) for q = 2π a (0, k, l) in the k-l plane at h = 0 . The results are the same as those where h and k in Fig. 2B are replaced with l and h respectively and k and l respectively. These are understandable from the symmetry of the hedgehog shown in Fig. 1A. Namely, the alignment of the magnetic moments on the IC is invariant under the permutation of the x, y, and z axes so that the same results of SIC(q) are obtained by replacing (qx , qy , qz) with (qz , qx , qy) and also with (qy , qz , qx)18. Dispersion of magnetic excitation from the hedgehog ground state. To clarify the property of the magnetic excitation in the uniform hedgehog order in the 1/1 AC, we employ the linear spin-wave theory (see Section “Methods”). Namely, we apply the Holstein-Primakoff transformation37 to H, the “spin” operators are transformed to the boson operators as Si · êi3 = S − ni with ni ≡ a†i ai , S−i = a†i √ 2S − ni , and S+i = √ 2S − niai , where S+i (S − i ) is the raising (lowering) “spin” operator and a † i (ai) is a creation (annihilation) operator of the boson at the ith Tb site. We retain the quadratic terms of the boson operators since the higher order terms are irrelevant at least for the ground state. By taking the primitive unit cell under the periodic boundary condition, (8)FL(q) = 1 N2L sin2(π h̃N1) sin2(π h̃) sin2(π k̃N1) sin2(π k̃) sin2(π l̃N1) sin2(π l̃) . (9) SIC(q) = 1 36 ( 1+ τ τ + 2 ) {1− cos(4πhd2)} + 1 36 ( 1− τ τ + 2 ) {1− cos(4πkd1)} + 1 36 [ 1− cos(4πhd1) cos(4πkd2)+ τ τ + 2 {cos(4πhd1)− cos(4πkd2)} ] + 2 9 τ τ + 2 {sin(2πhd1) sin(2πhd2) cos(2πkd2)+ cos(2πhd1) sin(2πkd1) sin(2πkd2)}.
