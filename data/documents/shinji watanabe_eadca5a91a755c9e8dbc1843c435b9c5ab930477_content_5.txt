The excitation energy ωm′(q) is obtained by diagonalizing the spin-wave Hamiltonian under the assumption that the uniform arrangement of the hedgehog state in the 1/1 AC. The result of ωm′(q) for q (solid line) along the symmetry line illustrated in the inset is shown in Fig. 3. We have confirmed that by assuming the uniform hedgehog ground state, all the excitation energies are positive ωm′(q) > 0 for J1 = 1.0 , J2 = 2.3 , and D = 50.0 as shown in Fig. 3. Positive excitation energies indicate that the assumed ground state is stable at least as a local minimum in the energy landscape. Although the AFM interaction between the ICs conflicts with uniform arrangement of the hedgehog state, the strong uniaxial anisotropy D = 50.0 as well as the strong N.N.N. AFM interaction J2 inside the IC gives rise to the metastable state within the linear spin-wave theory. It should be noted here that the true ground state is the hedgehog-anti-hedgehog ordered state as shown in Ref.16 and the uniform hedgehog order is the metastable state with the higher energy. In this report, the results for J1 = 1.0 , J2 = 2.3 , and D = 50.0 are presented as the representative case of the uniform hedgehog order. Figure 3 shows ωm′(q) for q (solid line) along the symmetry line illustrated in the inset. Because of the uniaxial anisotropy due to the CEF, the energy dispersion emerges beyond the excitation gap. We also plot ωm′(−q) (dashed line) for q along the same symmetry line for the ωm′(q) in Fig. 3. It is remarkable that clear deviation from the solid line emerges along the N-P-Ŵ line, indicating ωm′(q) �= ωm′(−q) . Namely, nonreciprocal excitation appears in the uniform hedgehog order in the 1/1 AC. We have calculated the magnon dispersion in the collinear FM order in the 1/1 AC and have confirmed that the nonreciprocal dispersion does not
