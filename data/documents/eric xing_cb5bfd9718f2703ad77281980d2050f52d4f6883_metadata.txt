Title: A Magnetically Controlled Guidewire Robot System with Steering and Propulsion Capabilities for Vascular Interventional Surgery
Year: 2023
Abstract: Magnetically manipulated interventional robotic systems offer outstanding advantages for improving vascular interventions, including minimizing radiation exposure to physicians and increasing the controllability of magnetic interventional devices in hard‐to‐reach vessels. However, automatic control of magnetic guidewires (MGs) is still challenging in terms of modeling of guidewires and trajectory planning. Herein, a magnetically controlled guidewire robotic system (MCGRS) with steering and propulsion capabilities is proposed based on adequate modeling and trajectory planning methods. The steering kinematics of MG is first modeled by constant curvature theory. Then, a continuum mechanics model is built to predict the deformation of the magnetic tip by combining the dipole model and the Cosserat‐rod model. Moreover, a trajectory planning algorithm is developed to navigate the MG through vessels. Furthermore, trajectory following experiments within three vascular phantoms confirm that the proposed model and algorithm are reliable and capable of navigating the MG through the desired trajectory. Finally, two extra navigation experiments are implemented in 3D vascular phantom, which show that the MCGRS can be remotely controlled to manipulate the MG to actively steer and reach the target site. The system and methods will build the foundation for automatic control of MG and help to improve the autonomy.
