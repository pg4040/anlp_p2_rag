were administered every 12 h, and Cmin was simulated by day 4 (72 h). The dashed blue and red lines indicate the target Cmin of 15 mg/L (non-complicated infections) and 20 mg/L (complicated infections), respectively. Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08 teicoplanin was AUC for 0–24 h, while extending the dosing interval mainly affects teicoplanin exposure during the elimination phase, hence the effect on AUC0-24 is not as intuitive as the effect of reducing the unit dose. This provides some new information, as in teicoplanin instruction (EMA., 2022), both decreasing unit dose or prolonging dosage interval are recommended for renal insufficient patients, but whether the two methods may cause a difference in teicoplanin 0–24 h exposure is not mentioned. Our finding is consistent with the review by Gilbert (Gilbert et al., 2009), in which extending the dosing interval was the only recommendation for teicoplanin administration in patients with renal failure. The findings also suggested that for teicoplanin, AUC0-24/MIC may be a more sensitive PK/PD indicator than trough concentration. Though Cmin is a common index for glycopeptide TDM and dose optimization, it does not take bacterial susceptibility into account, which is considered to affect the clinical outcome (Lodise et al., 2008). Therefore, in this study, we also calculated the AUC0-24/MIC, PTA, and CFR as targets based on evidence suggesting that these indicators were associated with both bacteriological efficacy and prevention of drug resistance (Rose et al., 2008; Matsumoto et al., 2016). Since Cmin, 72h, which is recommended as a surrogate measure for teicoplanin TDM, is correlated with loading dosage, whereas AUC0-24/MIC is more closely related to maintenance dosage, the optimal dosing regimens obtained by the above two indicators were slightly inconsistent, but the overall difference was not significant (Table 3). The simulation results showed that the PTA was above 90% for most of the simulated dosages against MRSA with anMIC of Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09 0.5 mg/L; however, it decreased to 33.1%–74.4% at anMIC of 1 mg/L in patients with varying renal function with the index of AUC0-24/ MIC ≥610, and no simulated regimen was able to get the PTA to the 90% target (Figure 4). In addition, CFR results showed the teicoplanin unit dose of 15 mg/kg q24h in patients with GFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 15 mg/kg q48h in patients with GFR 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2, and 15 mg/kg q72h in patients with GFR 15 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 allowed patients to achieve an acceptable CFR of nearly 80%; similarly, none of the simulated regimens could bring the CFR to 90% target (Figure
