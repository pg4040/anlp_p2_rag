of each therapy session, both the therapist and the client participants completed the therapist and client versions of the short form of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR; [28, 30]), a widely used measure of alliance in therapy. The WAI consists of three subscales that measure the three distinct components of a working alliance: 2Approximately 6% of video frames were excluded for low tracking confdence. 3Note that positive emotion words and negative emotion words are subcategories of afective words. • the goal subscale, which evaluates the individual’s belief that participants agree on the overall objectives of the treatment; • the task subscale, which evaluates the individual’s belief that participants agree on the steps required to achieve those goals; and • the bond subscale, which evaluates the individual’s emotional respect and trust for the other participant. Each subscale consists of statements that the individual rates on a fve-point Likert-type scale ranging from “seldom true” to “always true”. The client version of the inventory contains 12 items, while the therapist version contains 10 items. For the purposes of this analysis, we combine the task and goal subscales due to very high correlation: these two subscales achieve Pearson’s correlation coeffcient of � = 0.96 between them.4 Representative items for each subscale are presented in Table 1.
