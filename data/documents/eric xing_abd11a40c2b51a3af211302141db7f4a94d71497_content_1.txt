charge distribution for deposited energies in the calorimeter of 1TeV to 1.58 TeV. The boron, carbon and oxygen candidates are selected with energy-independent charge intervals of [4.7, 5.3], [5.6, 6.5] and [7.6, 8.5], respectively. After the charge selection, we have 1.16 × 105 boron, 1.27 × 106 carbon and 2.17 × 106 oxygen candidates with EBGO > 80 GeV.
