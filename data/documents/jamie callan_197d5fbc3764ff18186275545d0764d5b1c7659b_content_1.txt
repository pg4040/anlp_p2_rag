40. This confirms the previously seen low divergence for 2019, to the left of the vertical line of Figure 3, between the relevant entity set and the retrieved entity set. To the right of the vertical line of Figure 3 as the divergence between sets increases, the EC model performance also decreases across all systems that use more than 40 passages to build the graph. After this point, the introduced noisy entities lead to sharp drops in performance across all graph sizes, showing the need for a balance between graph size, and ranking depth. Large graphs with many non-relevant entities for the passages to be reranked, or on the other hand, small graphs that do not cover the relevant entities of the passages to be reranked will lead to deficient results. Another interesting observation, that confirms the observations so far, is that as the graph size increases, there are faster diminishing returns as the reranking depth is also increased. That is, for a graph built with 100 passages (Graph-100 - pink line in Fig. 2), there is too much noise in the graph to rerank more than 40 passages, thus the centrality ranking signals perform worse than the BERT baselines. This observation ties back to Figure 3, where the median graph size built with 100 passages has approximately 500 entities (in Figure 3 when Nr. of Passages in Ranking = 100, the Median Entity Count is ≈ 500). Many of these entities will be noise as we can see from the gap between the lines in Figure 3.
