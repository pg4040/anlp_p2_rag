Title: Hence, Socrates is mortal: A Benchmark for Natural Language Syllogistic Reasoning
Year: 2023
Abstract: Syllogistic reasoning, a typical form of deductive reasoning, is a critical capability widely required in natural language understanding tasks, such as text entailment and question answering. To better facilitate research on syllogis-tic reasoning, we develop a benchmark called S YLLO B ASE that differs from existing syllo-gistic datasets in three aspects: (1) Covering a complete taxonomy of syllogism reasoning patterns; (2) Containing both automatically and manually constructed samples; and (3) Involving both the generation and understanding tasks. We automatically construct 50k template-based syllogism samples by mining syllogism patterns from Wikidata and ConceptNet. To improve our datasetâ€™s naturalness and challenge, we apply GPT-3 to paraphrase the template-based data and further manually rewrite 1,000 samples as the test set. State-of-the-art pre-trained language models can achieve the best generation ROUGE-L of 38.72 by T5 and the best multi-choice accuracy of 72.77% by RoBERTa on S YLLO B ASE , which indicates the great challenge of learning diverse syllo-gistic reasoning types on S YLLO B ASE .
