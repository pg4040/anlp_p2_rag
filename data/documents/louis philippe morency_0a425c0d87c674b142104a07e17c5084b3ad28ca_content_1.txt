towards learning better representations. 3. Principled approaches to fairness and invariance: Currently, PID is designed to measure the information that 2 variables contribute towards a task Y , but conversely it can also be used to remove information that one variable can have about Y , in the context of another variable. These could provide formal learning objectives for fairness, privacy, and other feature invariance tasks.
