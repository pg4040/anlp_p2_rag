score computed on the concatenation of the three test sets (Joint BLEU, third column).⋅ The “D” column indicates the data condition in which each submitted run was trained, namely: Constrained (C), constrained+LLM (C+), Unconstrained (U).⋅ For the BLEU scores computed on the TED test set, “Orig” and “New” respectively indicate the results computed on the original (subtitle-like) TED translations and the unconstrained (exact, more literal) translations as references.⋅ Direct systems are indicated by gray background.⋅ “*” indicates a late submission.⋅ “+” indicates an unofficial submission. B.2 Simultaneous SLT B.3 Automatic Subtitling B.4 Multilingual Speech Translation Below we show the Multilingual task (§5) results and overall rankings, ordered according to the average chrF across all 10 target languages after resegmentation to the reference translations. We also compare to the Offline submissions on the ACL 60-60 evaluation set on the 3 language pairs used for the Offline task. Finally, we show the scores for each metric (chrF, COMET, BLEU) per language pair for all systems. B.5 Speech-to-Speech Translation
