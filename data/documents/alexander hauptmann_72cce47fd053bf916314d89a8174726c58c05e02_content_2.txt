According to WikiData Term of Use, we can freely reuse and build upon on WikiData. According to the Twitter Developer Agreement and Policy, we will only release IDs instead of actual content for noncommercial research purposes from academic institutions. • To ensure the proper use of this work, we will not release the data via a publicly available access point. Instead, we will release the data based on individual request and we will ask for consent that 1) requesters are from research institutions 2) they will follow all the regulations when using our work 3) they will not use the model to infer non-public users unless obtained proper consent from those users.
