zero charge is observed for layers in which the particles passes between the ladders with Si-strip detectors. P o S ( I C R C 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 2 mono-energetic, collimated beam of particles, the survival fraction follows an exponential decay: 𝑁 (𝑧) 𝑁 (𝑧 = 0) = 1 − exp(−𝜌 · 𝜎 · 𝑧), (1) where 𝑧 is the distance covered by the particles, 𝜌 the BGO density, and 𝜎 the inelastic hadronic cross section. Data observed with DAMPE, however, consists of a mixture of events at different incident angles, entry points, and energies. The underlying distribution of these variables is given by the source spectrum convoluted with the detector response (after applying our event selection). For this reason, event counts do not follow a simple exponential decay; and we instead use MC to evaluate how the survival fraction is affected by changes to the cross section. The BGO calorimeter consists of 14 layers with 22 bars each. BGO data can thus be presented as a 22×14 image, in which each pixel represents the signal from a single BGO bar. We normalise these images such that the maximal pixel of the image corresponds to 1, and then decode the pixel values using 8 bit precision. A convolutional neural network is then applied to predict the layer in which the primary particle interacts inelastically. This CNN was trained on a mixture of Geant4 and FLUKA simulation. Aside from the output, the network is the same to that published in [19], and we hence refer readers to this publication for further details on the architecture and training of the CNN. We validated that our CNN can reproduce the true survival fraction with . 1% accuracy. Based on the CNN prediction, the fraction of events, 𝛼, that pass two BGO layers without interacting is calculated. Specifically, we consider the ratio between events that interact inelastically after the third and first BGO layer. This choice is motivated by three main considerations: • After two layers, roughly half of the events have converted, giving us optimal statistics. • The signal in the first layer can be used to ensure the particle did not convert before BGO. • 11 layers of the calorimeter remain to accurately estimate the shower energy. The ratio 𝛼 is computed for data and then compared to that obtained for MC. If cross sections in MC are too low (high), it follows that 𝛼MC will be higher (lower) than 𝛼data. Re-weighting MC.
