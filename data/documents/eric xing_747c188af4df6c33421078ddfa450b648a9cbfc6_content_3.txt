Section: 4. Analysis
𝛼MC as a function of cross section, simulation sets are required in which the cross section is artificially increased or decreased. Simulating such events in large statistics, over an extended energy range, for different ion species, and for various cross sections would be very computationally expensive. We hence instead opt to re-weight our simulation. The main effect that comes from changing the cross section is that it induces a shift of the interacting vertex, 𝑧𝑖 . Higher (lower) cross sections imply that more (less) particles interact early on. Events are weighted to reflect this change. Specifically, we bin events as a function of their angle of incidence, 𝜃, and energy, 𝐸 , such that Eq. (1) is applicable to each bin. We then note that under a change of the cross section, 𝜎′ = (1 + 𝜖) · 𝜎, the cumulative distribution function of the interaction vertex, 𝐹 (𝑧𝑖), changes in the following way: 𝐹 (𝑧𝑖 |𝜎′) = 1 − [1 − 𝐹 (𝑧𝑖 |𝜎)]1+𝜖 . (2) Deriving 𝐹 (𝑧𝑖) with respect to 𝑧𝑖 to obtain probability density function, 𝑓 , it then follows that the weighting factor corresponds to the ratio 𝑤 = 𝑓 (𝑧𝑖 |𝜎′)/ 𝑓 (𝑧𝑖 |𝜎). These weights are computed over a 3 dimensional grid (𝜃, 𝐸, 𝑧𝑖). A 3d linear interpolator is then applied for a more accurate and efficient evaluation, and to remove binning artefacts. It is worth noting that this weighting scheme is applied to different 𝑧-ranges of the detector individually.

Additionally, we produced small statistics Geant4 simulation sets with increased and decreased cross sections to demonstrate that these reproduce the same shift
