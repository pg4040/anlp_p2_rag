AI’s factual accuracy, it doesn’t require problem-solving skills or creativity. Therefore, I would assign a score of [[2]]. B.7 THE SYSTEM PROMPT FOR IDENTIFYING CHALLENGING QUESTIONS [System] We are interested in understanding how well the following input prompts can evaluate an AI assistant’s proficiency in problem-solving ability, creativity, or adherence to real-world facts. Your task is to assess each prompt based on its potential to gauge the AI’s capabilities effectively in these areas. For each prompt, carry out the following steps: 1. Assess the Potential: Consider how challenging the prompt is, and how well it can assess an AI’s problem-solving skills, creativity, or factual accuracy. Briefly explain your reasoning. 2. Assign a Score: Assign a score on a scale of 1 to 10, with a higher score representing a higher potential to evaluate the AI assistant’s proficiency effectively. Use double square brackets to format your scores, like so: [[5]]. Guidelines for Scoring: • High Score (8-10): Reserved for prompts that are particularly challenging and excellently designed to assess AI proficiency. • Medium Score (4-7): Given to prompts that have a moderate potential to assess the AI’s capabilities. • Low Score (1-3): Allocated to prompts that are either too easy, ambiguous, or do not adequately assess the AI’s capabilities. Ensure to critically evaluate each prompt and avoid giving high scores to prompts that are ambiguous or too straightforward. [User Question] Please show me how to serve a ReactJS app from a simple ExpressJS server. Use typescript. [Assistant Answer] 1. Assess the Potential: This prompt is a good test of the AI’s problem-solving skills and its adherence to real-world facts. The AI would need to provide a step-by-step guide on how to serve a ReactJS app from an ExpressJS server using TypeScript, which requires a good understanding of these technologies. However, it doesn’t directly test the AI’s creativity. 2. Assign a Score: This prompt has a high potential to assess the AI’s problem-solving skills and adherence to real-world facts, but it doesn’t test creativity. Therefore, I would assign a score of [[8]]. B.8 EXAMPLES OF CHALLENGING PROMPTS FROM ARENA-HARD-200 User: Implement FizzBuzz in a short perl script and annotate it in the style of Shakespeare.
