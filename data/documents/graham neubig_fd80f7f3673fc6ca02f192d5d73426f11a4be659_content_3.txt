Section: 6.1 Experimental Setup
P (S⋆maj)| |P (S⋆maj)| (2) Intuitively, we care for overall precision (regardless of severity) since we want to make sure predicted errors tend to be marked by annotators as well, but for recall we care mostly for major errors, as these have a larger impact on translation quality and are more critical to identify. Additionally, we also report the (3) Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), one of the official metrics in the wordlevel quality estimation tasks (Zerva et al., 2022).
