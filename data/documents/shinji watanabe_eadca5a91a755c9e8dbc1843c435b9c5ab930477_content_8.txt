the IC. The propagation of the precession to the 10th site is illustrated by the yellow arrow.

This excited state describes the precession around the ordered moment direction, i.e., z axis, which propagates to neighboring sites via the exchange interaction J1(SixSjx + SiySjy) . Namely, the excited state at the ith site propagates to the jth site as Here, the relation of Six = (S+i + S−i )/2 and Siy = (S+i − S−i )/(2i) and S+i |5� = √ 12|6� and S−i |6� = √ 12|5� are used. Hence, for the right neighbor site j = i + 1 , the excitation is expressed as the plane wave 6J1 exp{iq · (ri − ri+1)} = 6J1 exp(−iqxa) where a is the lattice constant. For the left neighbor site j = i − 1 , the excitation is expressed as the plane wave 6J1 exp{iq · (ri − ri−1)} = 6J1 exp(iqxa) . The superposition of these yields the excitation energy ε(q) of the magnon Since the right moving wave and left moving wave both have the same matrix element 6J1 as Eq. (12), the excitation has the reciprocal energy with respect to the transverse wavevector to the ordered moment direction, i.e., ε(−qx) = ε(qx) . It is noted that we have confirmed that the reciprocal magnon dispersion appears in the collinear FM order in the 1/1 AC (Supplementary information, Fig. S2). Next, let us consider the excitation from the uniform hedgehog ordered state in the 1/1 AC composed of the regular IC. Suppose that among 12 vertices of the regular IC with the |J = 6, Jz = 6� states, an excited state |J = 6, Jz = 5� is created at a single site, e.g., the ith site. This excited state can propagate to the neighboring sites via the interaction J1Si · Sj . Since the |J , Jz� state is defined at each site with the local coordinate, hereafter we denote the state at the ith site as |Jz�i . The neighboring |Jz = 5�i ⊗ |Jz = 6�j state is exchanged as where Rinn′ is the rotation matrix at the ith site defined in Eq. (20) (see Section “Methods”). Note that as expressed by the n = 3 component in the right hand side (r.h.s.) of Eq. (14), Szi Szj also contributes to the exchange of |5�i|6�j and |6�i|5�j because
