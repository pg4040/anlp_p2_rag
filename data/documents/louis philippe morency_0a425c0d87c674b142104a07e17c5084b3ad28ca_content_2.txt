Section: C.7 Quantifying Model Predictions
when Xi is missing, these interactions can no longer be discovered by the model which decreases robustness. For the subset of points when Ui ≤ 0.05, the correlation between S and performance drop is ρ = 0.73 while the correlation between R and performance drop is only ρ = 0.01.
