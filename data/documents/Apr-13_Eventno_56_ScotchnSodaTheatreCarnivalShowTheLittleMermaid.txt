Event Details: 
Come celebrate Carnival with Scotch'n'Soda Theatre, and join us for a performance under the sea! This year, Scotch'n'Soda is thrilled to present our production of Disney's The Little Mermaid! Adapted from the wildly popular animated film and Hans Christian Anderson's original fairytale, the musical follows Ariel, King Triton's youngest daughter, who wishes to explore the world up above and pursue the human Prince Eric. But the bargains and sea witches aren't all that they seem, and Ariel needs the help of her colorful friends, Flounder the fish, Scuttle the seagull and Sebastian the crab to restore order under the sea. Sing along with all of your favorite childhood classics, and come be a part of our world! Funded in part by the Student Activities Fee. Note: Disney's The Little Mermaid is presented through special arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI). All authorized performance materials are also supplied by MTI.
