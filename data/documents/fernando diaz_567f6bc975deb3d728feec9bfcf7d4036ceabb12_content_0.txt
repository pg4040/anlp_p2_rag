Section: 7 Ethical Considerations
In this work we attempt to promote ethical recommendation by addressing the problem of popularity bias in music recommendation. However, there are a few important caveats to the work presented above. Crucially, ourwork is influenced by largermovements within the music streaming and information retrieval communities that come with important ethical considerations. First, due to our reliance on publicly available data, we are limited in our exploration of multi-cultural, and specifically non-Western musical content. The under representation of such content has long been an issue within the music communities and, concretely in our setting, it manifests itself in cutting off the flow of financial capital towards under-represented artists. Second, due to the lack of transparency regarding the calculation of Spotifyâ€™s metadata, we are unable to assess whether the musical features distributed by the platform (and used in our work) are disenfranchising content from non-Western musical traditions. Finally, the construction of user bases can also have very significant effects on how connections between artists are formed. Thus, it is equally important to note that the ground truth data that we are using to perform recommendation is most likely very dominated by North American and European listeners. We hope that in the future, greater collaboration between industry and academia can foster the necessary transparency to address these issues more concretely.
