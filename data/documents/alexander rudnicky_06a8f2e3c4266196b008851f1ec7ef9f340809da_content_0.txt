A.1 Proof of Proposition 2 Denote (A0, u0), (A−, u−), and (A1, u1) as the pair of (transition matrix, input vector) w.r.t. input character 0, -, and 1. Note that A0, A−, and A1 are diagonal matrices by assumption. Denote z as the initial state vector. The sequences "0-1" and "1-0" are represented as x0−1 = A1A−A0z +A1A−u0 +A1u− + u1 x1−0 = A0A−A1z +A0A−u1 +A0u− + u0. Note x0−1 is for "0-1" while x1−0 for "1-0". Because A’s are diagonal, we know A1A−A0 = A0A−A1. Because 0 − 1 ̸= 1 − 0, by enforcing x0−1 ̸= x1−0, we have A1A−u0+A1u−+u1 ̸= A0A−u1+A0u−+u0. (8) On the other hand, let x0− = A−A0z+A−u0+u− be the vector representation for "0-". Consider two other sequences: "0-0-1" and "0-1-0". Their vector representations are x0−0−1 = A1A−A0x0− +A1A−u0 +A1u− + u1 x0−1−0 = A0A−A1x0− +A0A−u1 +A0u− + u0. Note x0−0−1 is for "0-0-1" while x0−1−0 for "0-1-0". Similarly, because A’s are diagonal and 0 − 0 − 1 = 0 − 1 − 0, by enforcing x0−0−1 = x0−1−0, we have A1A−u0+A1u−+u1 = A0A−u1+A0u−+u0. (9) Because Eq. (8) contradicts with Eq. (9), the two relations x0−1 ̸= x1−0 and x0−0−1 = x0−1−0 cannot co-exist. We hence conclude that an inputdependent diagonal linear RNN is inconsistent in representing subtraction.
