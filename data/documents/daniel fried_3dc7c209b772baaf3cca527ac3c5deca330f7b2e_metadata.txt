Title: Exploratory Analysis of Objective Outcome Measures for the Clinical Assessment of Erosive Tooth Wear
Year: 2023
Abstract: This study proposed using enamel surface texture and thickness for the objective detection and monitoring of erosive tooth wear (ETW), comparing them to the standard subjective Basic Erosive Wear Evaluation (BEWE). Thirty-two subjects (n = 597 teeth) were enrolled in this longitudinal observational clinical study. Enamel thickness (by cross-polarization optical coherence tomography, CP-OCT) and 3D dental microwear parameters, i.e., area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc), anisotropy (Str), and roughness (Sa) (by white-light scanning confocal profilometry), were obtained from buccal surfaces. Buccal, occlusal, and lingual surfaces were scored for BEWE and the maximum score per tooth (BEWEMax) was determined at baseline and 12 months (M12). Data outcome relationships were evaluated (alpha = 0.05). Enamel thickness decreased (p < 0.001), BEWE scores, Sa, and Str increased (p < 0.001), while Asfc did not change at M12. Baseline BEWEBuccal correlated strongly with BEWEMax (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) and moderately with BEWELingual (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), but not with enamel thickness (r = 0.03, p = 0.43). Change (Δ) in surface texture outcomes correlated poorly but significantly with ΔBEWEBuccal (r = −0.15–0.16, p < 0.001) and did not correlate with Δenamel thickness (r = 0.02–0.09, p > 0.06). Teeth with BEWE progression revealed a greater increase in ΔSa and ΔStr. These findings suggest that enamel surface roughness can potentially determine ETW severity, and CP-OCT may be relevant for clinically monitoring enamel thickness.
