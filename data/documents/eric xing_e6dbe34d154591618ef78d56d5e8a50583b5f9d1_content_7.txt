Networks Reveal Regulatory Modules Conserved Across Tissues in Cancer183 Contextualized networks reveal that tumors of the GI tract display a continuum of GRN dysregulation (Figure 6).184 While this continuum cannot be captured by existing TCGA subtypes [47], contextualized networks form clusters that185 relate existing subtypes to inter-disease and intra-disease heterogeneity via conserved regulatory motifs and shared186 dysregulation motifs. Contextualized networks reveal that tumors of the GI tract display a continuum of GRN dys-187 regulation (Figure 6). While this continuum cannot be captured by existing TCGA subtypes, contextualized networks188 form clusters that relate existing subtypes to inter-disease and intra-disease heterogeneity via conserved regulatory189 motifs and shared dysregulation motifs. Finally, contextualized networks discover disparate types of GRN dysregula-190 tion within patients assigned to the SCNA-derived GI.CIN subtype, comprising the majority of GI tract tumors (Fig.191 6a). Re-assigning patients based on GRN-derived subtypes improves prognosis (Fig. 6b) and reveals biomarkers of192 these dysregulation subtypes (Fig. 6a) including SNV-SCNA interactions such as HRAS mutations with chromosome193 18 arm p loss of heterozygosity.194 For each of the 25 tumor types, we cluster patients by their contextualized networks to identify network-based tumor196 subtypes by flattening the network parameters and applying hierarchical ward clustering. To compare the prognostic197 utility of network-based subtypes against the prognostic utility of state-of-the-art TCGA subtypes and expression198 subtypes, we use the same number of clusters for each disease as subtypes annotated in TCGA. We find that network-199 based subtypes are more prognostic on average than both expression-derived subtypes and TCGA subtypes (Table 2).200 In general, we find that network-based subtypes either recapitulate or refine prognostic subtypes produced by TCGA,201 which often utilize additional data types including DNA methylation, miRNA, and histopathological imaging. All202 subtype comparisons by disease are available in Appendix S4. For 10 of 25 tumor types, contextualized networks203 reduce one of the survival function p-values by at least an order of magnitude, and in some cases, as much as 9204 orders of magnitude on KIRC, 4 orders of magnitude on LGG, 2.4 orders of magnitude on THCA, and 2.3 orders205 of magnitude on HNSC. On KICH, both network subtypes and TCGA subtyapes are outperformed by expression206 subtypes by 13.5 orders of magnitude. In the second and third worst cases for contextualized networks, network207 subtypes are outperformed by TCGA subtypes on GBM and UVM in terms of survival prognosis by about 1.5 and 1.3208 orders of magnitude, respectively.209 7 8 9 10 Discussion210 In this study, we propose contextualized GRNs as cohesive sample-specific representations of latent tumor states211 underlying disease progression
