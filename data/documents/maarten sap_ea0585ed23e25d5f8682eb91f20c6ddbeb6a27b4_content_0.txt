For our user studies, we recruit annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk who were qualified for a toxicity explanation task from our previous work (Anonymous, 2020).4 Racial and gender breakdowns of our annotator pool are in Figure 5. Annotators were paid $0.27 per task. For each instance in each of the three settings we have 3 annotators. This study was approved by our institutionâ€™s ethics board (IRB). We show the detailed task instructions in Figure 6. An example of the task setup is shown in Figure 7. Before choosing the most convincing counter statements, annotators have the option to mark each statement as incorrect or ungrammatical (Figure 7b). Note that before asking annotators to select their second choice, we include an attention check (in Figure 7c). The attention check was randomly set in each HIT. Annotations where the attention check incorrect were discarded. As a result, we removed 3 annotations from the post setting, 5 from the stereo setting, and 4 from post+stereo. For each annotation, we also collected demographic information (Figure 8). The demographic information is associated only with an annonymized annotator ID. Additionally, before annotators select counter-statements, we ask annotators 3https://beta.openai.com/docs/ introduction 4Anonymized to preserve double-blindness of reviewing, will be de-anonymized upon public release.

All five types of counter statements are listed in the same manner. to indicate their own belief in or agreement with the provided statement and stereotype (Figure 9).
