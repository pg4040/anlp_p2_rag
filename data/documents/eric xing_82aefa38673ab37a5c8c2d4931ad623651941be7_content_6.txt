in Fig. 13. Here, the celestial coordinates δ(ξ) is obtained from x(y) by [36] δ μas = ( 6.191165 × 10−8 2π σ D/Mpc ) ( x M ) , (37) where δ is the mass ratio of the BH to the Sun, D represents distance and is fixed at 5 kpc. Apparently, the critical rings of the Schwarzschild BH and the Schwarzschild-MOG BH are similar in structure and resemble circles of diameter about 40 µas. Meanwhile, the difference in brightness between the two BHs is relatively small since the maximum luminosities of the rings are 7.02 × 106 erg s−1 cm−2 in Panel (a) and 8.27 × 106 erg s−1 cm−2 in Panel (b). Hence, identifying a Schwarzschild-MOG BH in this situation seems to be a Herculean task due to the degeneracy that makes it difficult to differentiate between the image cast by a Schwarzschild-MOG BH and a more massive Schwarzschild BH. Fortunately, this degeneracy can be eliminated by measuring the mass of the BH with other astronomical observations. As displayed in Fig. 14, when a BH is observed to have a critical ring diameter of 42 µas, we cannot directly determine whether it is a Schwarzschild BH (α = 0) with mass 6.89 × 109M or a Schwarzschild-MOG BH with mass 3.79 × 109M and parameter α = 1. However, when the BH mass is estimated as 4.94 × 109M using other astronomical measurements, α = 0.5 can be uniquely determined. It is worth noting that the radio signals of the extremely narrow ring cannot be captured by the Earth-extended EHT with its current angular resolution (about 20 µas at 1.3 mm), which is limited by the Earth’s diameter. In order to simulate the nominal resolution of the EHT [17,34], we blur Fig. 12 with a Gaussian filter with standard deviation equal to 1/12 the field of view and obtain the second and fourth rows of Fig. 15 (The first and third rows are the copy of Fig. 12). One can realize that not only is the luminosity of the image reduced, but more critically, the ring structure is washed out. Nevertheless, we still believe that our results are potentially valuable for identifying the Schwrzschild-MOG BHs and constraining the gravitational coupling parameter α when the high-resolution images of the BHs are obtained with Space-Earth VLBI of the observatory located around the Lagrangian L2 point of the Sun-Earth system [80,81].
