Section: B Supplementary proofs
In this section, we provide a comprehensive proof for Lemma 1, Theorem 1, and Theorem 2, which are discussed in Section B.1 and Section B.2. These proofs pertain to the general framework 2, incorporating adaptive learning rate and weight decay. Additionally, in Section B.3, we focus on the specific context of FedNAR and present a detailed analysis of its properties by showcasing interesting characteristics. B.1 Proof of Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 These two results exemplify the distinctive update dynamics exhibited by our framework, encompassing both the specific update formula and an upper bound constraint on the parameter norm. Lemma 1. For round t ≥ 1, the global update is equivalent to be xt = (1− µt−1g )xt−1 − λght, where µt−1g := λg − λg M M∑ i=1 τ−1∏ j=0 (1− µt,ij ), h t := 1 M M∑ i=1 τ−1∑ j=0 λt,ij τ−1∏ r=j (1− µt,ir )gt,ij . (6) Proof. For round 1 ≤ t ≤ T and client 1 ≤ i ≤ M , write the the update for iteration 1 ≤ k ≤ τ , we have: xt,i1 = (1− µ t,i 0 )x t,i 0 − λ t,i 0 g t,i 0 , ..., xt,iτ = (1− µ t,i τ−1)x t,i τ−1 − λ t,i τ−1g t,i τ−1. Compute xt,iτ iteratively, we have: xt,iτ = τ−1∏ j=0 (1− µt,ij )x t,i 0 − τ−1∑ j=0 λt,ij τ−1∏ r=j (1− µt,ir )g t,i j , local update ∆t,i = xt,i0 − xt,iτ = 1− τ−1∏ j=0 (1− µt,ij ) xt,i0 + τ−1∑ j=0 λt,ij τ−1∏ r=j (1− µt,ir )g t,i j , and aggregated local updates (pseudo gradient) ∆t = 1 M M∑ i=1 ∆t,i = 1− 1 M τ−1∏ j=0 (1− µt,ij ) xt,i0 + 1M M∑ i=1 τ−1∑ j=0 λt,ij τ−1∏ r=j (1− µt,ir )g t,i j . So the global update is xt = xt−1 −λg∆t = 1− λg + λg M M∑ i=1 τ−1∏ j=0 (1− µt,ij ) xt−1 − λg M M∑ i=1 τ−1∑ j=0 λt,ij τ−1∏ r=j (1−µt,ir )g t,i j , which is the form in the Lemma. In the following, we denote [N ] := {1, 2, · · · , N}, and ξt(g, x) := λt(g, x)g + µt(g, x)x for 1 ≤ t ≤ T . Theorem 1. If the functions λt and µt satisfy that there exists A > 0, such that for any t ≥ 0, and (g, x) ∈ Rd × Rd, ∥λt(g, x)g + µt(g, x)x∥ ≤ A, then the norm of
