Semantic similarity scores BERTurk+NLI+ STS (Cross-Encoder/ Bi-Encoder): 81.02/ 89.62 more similar to the reference summaries, compared to the summaries generated by ROUGE-L reward and MLE-only models, in terms of semantic similarity scores. It should be noted that the reference or generated summaries could be truncated as we restricted the maximum summary length in our experiments. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1351324923000505 Published online by Cambridge University Press The incident occurred in a technology store in the capital, Tbilisi. A 32-year-old man entered the store and took a female employee hostage with a knife. The robber tried to rob the store. In the footage reflected on the security camera, it was seen that the suspect grabbed the woman by the neck with his arm and threatened other employees by waving the knife in his hand. The suspect, who saw the police teams coming, left the woman, raised his hands in the air and surrendered. It is stated that the suspect, who was taken into custody, could be sentenced to 7 to 10 years in prison Reference summary .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
