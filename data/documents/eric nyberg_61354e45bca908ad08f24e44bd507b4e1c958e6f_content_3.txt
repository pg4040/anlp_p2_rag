heuristics, as done in Ma et al. (2022a) to construct the final top 100 evidence chains. For HotpotQA, single retrieval and linking are used jointly to find the first-hop passages where we keep top 200 passages from single retrieval and top 5 passage from each linked question entity. The combined set is then reranked to keep the top 30 first-hop passages. Then expanded query retrieval and passage entity linking are applied to these 30 passages, where we keep top 50 passages from expanded query retrieval and top 2 passages from every linked passage entity. Next, another round of reranking is performed on the newly collected passages and then we sort the evidence passage chains based on the final aggregated score and keep top 100 chains. Since all of the baselines on HotpotQA adopt a large passage path reranker, we also trained such a model following (Zhu et al., 2021) (discussed in Appendix C) to rank the top 100 passage #Params EM FiD (Izacard and Grave, 2021) 770M 51.4 UnitedQA-E (Cheng et al., 2021) 330M 51.8 FiD-KD (Izacard and Grave, 2020) 770M 54.4 EMDR2 (Singh et al., 2021) 440M 52.5 YONO (Lee et al., 2021) 440M 53.2 UnitedQA (Cheng et al., 2021) 1.87B 54.7 R2-D2 (Fajcik et al., 2021) 1.29B 55.9 FiE (Kedia et al., 2022) 330M 58.4 FiE (ours implementation) 330M 56.3 COS + FiE 330M 56.4 Table A2: End-to-end QA Exact Match score on NQ chains to get the top 1 prediction. The hyperparameters for OTT-QA and HotpotQA inference are selected such that the total number of evidence chains are comparable to previous works (Ma et al., 2022a; Xiong et al., 2021b).
