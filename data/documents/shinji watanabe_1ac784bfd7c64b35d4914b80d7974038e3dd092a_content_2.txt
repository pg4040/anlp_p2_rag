The intervention consisted of continuous supplements of MCTs combined with moderate-intensity equivalent walking for 12 weeks. The results showed significant improvements in scores on several subscales of the SF-36 in all MCTs supplement groups, compared to the control group. Therefore, regardless of the octanoic and decanoic acid composition, it is speculated that the combination of a continuous daily intake of 2 g or more of MCTs and walking may have an effect on subjective health and HRQOL in healthy middle-aged and older adults with lower BMIs and no exercise habits. This study evaluated the effects of continuous MCTs intake and a moderate-intensity exercise intervention on mental and physical aspects
