Note that the stars filter removes the most data (over 60%) and, therefore, raises the question whether the performance difference is due to the smaller dataset. However, as can be seen in Figure 3, HumanEval pass@100 diverged early on in training, indicating that the drop in performance is not only due to data size but also data quality.
