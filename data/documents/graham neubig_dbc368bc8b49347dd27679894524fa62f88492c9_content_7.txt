In the town of Ivanovna, the lieutenant-colonel of the Mushenkhanovitch is accused of the murder of his brother Ivanovitch. The lieutenant-in-command, Vasilyevitch, takes the form of a dog, and the two men–the two men and the woman who are questioned by the court-martial–murphy. The two men cry out to the God of Russia for help in their quest to save the town.

He tells the court that he loves her, but he has yet to tell her the true story. The men, in this room, demand a man to kill her, and she will not betray them. The women, in their own country, are
