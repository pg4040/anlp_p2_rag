time is less than with IMRT or 3D (Figure 1). These are the only categories evaluated for indirect cost, which represents at most 26.17% and 17.27% of the annual household income ($3,586.32) [15] with the 3D QTRT28 + BATD + VMAT RT25 and VMAT QTRT28 + BATD schemes, respectively (Table 3). This result is worrisome, due to the risk of incurring catastrophic costs and increasing barriers to compliance with treatment [43–45].

However, the future option exists to offer hypofractionation of 15 sessions followed by 4 BATD applications in women with CT contraindications such as advanced illness with secondary renal dysfunction and hydronephrosis related to the tumour, borderline cardiac function; and fragile patients [47]. Similarly, by means of phase II trials NCT04070976 and NCT04583254, the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated doses are studied in CTRT. Currently, the recommended splits are between 25 and 28 sessions of special techniques with simultaneous integrated boost, which is impossible to accomplish this in a country with a marked deficit of RT equipment [48]. The international atomic energy agency ideally recommends four units of RT per million people, with a minimum of at least 1.5 units per million. However, currently, one unit of RT helps 0.12 million people in HIC, in contrast to 1 million in MIC and 5 million in LIC [19, 49]. The institute has an assigned population of approximately 3,681,400 with only two linear particle accelerators; therefore, it cannot provide special technical treatment to all of the patients due to the high demand. Replicate this scenario on a national level with a population of 33.72 million and only 59 sets of teletherapy equipment and 18 sets of brachytherapy (BT) equipment all of which are gathered in the capital city. This also occurs in China, India and Argentina where a disparity exists in the density of facilities within a country and only being able to receive treatment within a reasonable timeframe in modern cities [50–53]. In other studies of non-gynaecological pathology costs, they do simultaneous variation in the treatment time, capacity utilisation rates and the number of LINAC staff, obtaining a cost reduction [54]. The analysis was carried out with the minimum number of staff necessary for LINAC, two medical technologists.
