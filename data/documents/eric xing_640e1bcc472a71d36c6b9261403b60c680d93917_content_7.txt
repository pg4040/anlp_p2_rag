Transcription Factor and Target Gene Correlation Analysis in Fetal Cell Types In this analysis, we sought to elucidate the relationship between transcription factors (TFs) and their target gene expression across different cell types. Gene-by-motif files were aggregated and organized into a unified structure comprising genes, motifs, and corresponding cell features. We identified the target genes for each TF within predefined motif clusters, and computed the mean expressions of both the target genes and the corresponding TFs. To avoid potential artifacts caused by experimental batch effect in expression measurement, we performed the analysis both in adult+fetal cell types and also in only fetal cell types and get similar results. The relationship was assessed using Spearman correlation analysis, with the results visualized through scatter plots. The x-axis represented the mean expression of the target genes, and the y-axis represented the mean expression of the TFs. Each plot was annotated with the Spearman correlation coefficient and the associated p-value, providing a statistical assessment of the correlation. The analysis was performed iteratively for all TFs within the motif clusters specific to fetal cell types. The correlation coefficients and p-values were compiled, and the visualizations were saved as individual image files. This comprehensive view of the relationship between TFs and their target genes offers valuable insights into the regulatory dynamics within the context of fetal development. Regulatory embedding We collected the embedding of each gene after each transformer block of GET. For a gene g, itâ€™s embedding is defined as the embedding vector of the promoter in the output of i-th block. The embedding contains not only promoter information but also information from surrounding regions owing to the attention mechanism. In general, the deeper the layer, the more its space is dominated by the expression output. UMAP14 was used to visualize the embedding. Louvain clustering was performed on the embedding space to colorize the UMAP visualization. Resolution is arbitrarily chosen to keep the cluster number around 10 and close to the UMAP density. We computed the embedding in two different settings: cell type specific setting, where each dot is a gene embedding from a specific cell; cell type agnostic setting, where each dot is a gene embedding randomly sampled from all cell types. 50,000 embedding is sampled in the second case to make UMAP computation feasible. Causal discovery of regulator interaction We performed pairwise Spearman correlation using the gene-by-motif matrix also in both cell type specific and agnostic settings.
