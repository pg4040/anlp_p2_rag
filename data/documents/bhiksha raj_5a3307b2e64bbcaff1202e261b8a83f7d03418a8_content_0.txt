Section: 5 CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this paper presents a novel approach to exploring the voice-face correlation by focusing on the geometric aspects of the face rather than relying on semantic cues such as gender, age, and emotion. The proposed voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)face paradigm identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice to guide 3D face reconstruction, which results in significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium. This approach not only eliminates the influence of unpredictable AMs but also offers a new perspective on voice-face correlation, which can be valuable for anthropometry science. The results of this study open up possibilities for future research in this area, such as developing more accurate voice-guided face synthesis techniques and a better understanding of the relationship between voice and facial geometry.
