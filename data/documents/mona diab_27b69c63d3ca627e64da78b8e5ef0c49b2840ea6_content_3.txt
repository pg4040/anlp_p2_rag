50,000-fold more copies of the mitochondrial genome in plasma (Al Amir Dache et al., 2020), which accounts for 10–25% of the total cirDNA mass content; and (iii), the DII as determined by Q-PCR showed that nearly all cir-mtDNA is over 310 bp (Roch et al., 2021). Inside cells, mtDNA is bound with mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), constituting nucleoprotein complexes called nucleoids. As previously published (Bogenhagen, 2012), the copy number of mtDNA contained in a single nucleoid may vary between 1.4 and 7.5, depending on the cell type and the method used. TFAM are protein factors that may theoretically also protect cir-mtDNA in blood circulation. However, these types of nucleoprotein complexes are sedimenting following 100,000/200,000 g centrifugation speed, and therefore could represent at the most 4.4% of total cir-mtDNA, as shown here. These complexes are thus to be considered as a very minor part of cir-mtDNA and could not significantly influence our results. In contrast, cir-nDNA is highly fragmented with a DII showing a proportion of the number of detected fragments above 320 bp ranging from 10 to 20% (Meddeb et al., 2019a; Sanchez et al., 2021). Since practically no cir-mtDNA fragments were detected between 310 bp and 1,000 bp (Figure 1), which is the practical upper limit of read-out in LP-WGS sizing using either DSP-S or SSP-S, we infer that most cir-mtDNA fragments are over 1,000 bp. Our data converge with that of several other studies. For instance, using a Q-PCR-based assay, Ellinger et al. reported a plasma mtDNA integrity between 0.5 and 1.0 (Ellinger et al., 2009). Data obtained in this study confirmed our previous observation that the cir-mtDNA DII is always close to 1; this indicates that cirmtDNA is not or very poorly fragmented (Thierry and El Messaoudi, 2015). Note, we previously observed a much higher stability of cir-mtDNA compared to cir-nDNA extracted from serum-containing media of cultured cells (Otandault et al., 2020). Our postulate is that cir-mtDNA is either unfragmented when included in mitochondria (free or encapsulated in EVs) or very fragmented as observed in our WGS-based data.

In order to decipher the major structural forms of the detected cir-mtDNA, we carried
