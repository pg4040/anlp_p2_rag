Fig. 4C and D show the bacteriostatic efficacy of each treatment group for S. aureus. The survival rates of the Se@PDA, Se@PDA + NIR, ICG, ICG + NIR, Se@PDA-ICG and Se@PDA-ICG + NIR groups were 96.3%, 75.8%, 90.8%, 14.9%, 47.3% and 0%, indicating an excellent sterilization effect on S. aureus. Compared with E. coli, Se@PDA-ICG was more selective for S. aureus. More importantly, Se@PDA-ICG showed better in vitro antibacterial effects than similar types of nanomaterial, such as PDA-ICG-NPs encapsulated in mixed-shell polymeric otographs and data statistics of PBS, Se@PDA (125 mg mL−1), ICG (10.13 1.0 W cm−2, 10 min).

The antimicrobial porous collagen scaffolds containing chitosan and Se NPs were only effective in inhibiting S. aureus but not E. coli at all.20 Herein, Se@PDA-ICG was also more selective for S. aureus, which may arise from the structural differences in the bacterial outer membrane of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.9 To further investigate the antibacterial mechanism of Se@PDAICG, the cell morphology of bacteria aer Se@PDA-ICG treatment was observed by SEM. As can be seen in Fig. S6A and B,† the growth status of bacteria in the PBS control group was well maintained, so that the bacterial morphology was uniform and plump, while both bacterial surfaces in the Se@PDA-ICG + NIR experimental groups showed obvious wrinkling or rupture, so that the cell integrity was signicantly impaired. An excellent sterilization effect from the treatment was obtained as expected. It is speculated that the antibacterial mechanism may be that Se@PDA-ICG, which is distributed near the bacterial cell wall and cell membrane, rapidly heats up and produces
