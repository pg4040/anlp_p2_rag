energy is compatible with a low polarization level. When the break is fixed to 150 keV, both PDs at low and high energy are compatible with each other and with the energy integrated result. By looking at the posterior distributions of both PDs, the PD at low energy seems a bit more constrained to low values while the PD at high energy is spanning higher values. These two fitting functions have been used to analyse the entire POLAR catalog. Figure 4a shows the posterior distributions for the PD in the energy integrated compared to the PDs at low and high energy in the case where the energy break is free. For all the GRBs the three PD values are compatible with each other, while PDlow and PDhigh are a bit less constrained due to lower statistics, since fitting the data with a Heaviside function is equivalent two dividing the events into 2 energy bins. The energy break, shown in Figure 4b, is only constrained at low energy as we can see that values below 100 keV are highly suppressed. The PA for the energy integrated and resolved cases, as for GRB170114A, are compatible, as depicted in Figure 4c. 20 40 60 80 PD [%] 161203A energy integrated low energy high energy 161217C 161218A 161229A 170101A 170101B 170114A 170127C 170206A 170207A 170210A 170305A 170320A 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 PA [ ] 161203A energy integrated PD heavyside 161217C 161218A 161229A 170101A 170101B 170114A 170127C 170206A 170207A 170210A 170305A 170320A Figure 5: Result of the PD Heaviside fit for a fixed 150 keV energy break on the POLAR GRB catalog compared to the energy integrated results [2]. Left: Polarization degree for the integrated case and at low and high energy for the Heaviside fit. The three PD values are compatible with each other for all the GRBs, although there seems to be a difference between the PD at low and high energy in the posterior distributions. The limited statistics is preventing a more precise resolution between these two PD values. Right: Comparison of the obtained PA for the energy integrated and resolved cases. The PA for both cases are compatible for all GRBs of the catalog.

By checking the values of the PD, no significant energy dependence is observed. By looking at the
