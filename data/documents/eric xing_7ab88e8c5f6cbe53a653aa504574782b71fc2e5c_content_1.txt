Section: 4. Detection of gamma-ray sources
After performing the refit of the data by including the nearby sources within a 10-degree circle, a more stringent selection criterion is applied to the sources based on their TS value. In this case, only sources with a TS value greater than 25 are considered for inclusion in the final catalog. The resulting catalog consists of 248 sources that meet this more stringent criterion and are considered as the final sources of interest in the analysis. These sources have exhibited a high level of significance and are expected to represent genuine gamma-ray sources in the observed data. To determine the types of the sources in the final catalog, they are associated with the FermiLAT’s 4FGL catalog[10]. The 4FGL catalog is a comprehensive catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi-LAT instrument. It provides information about the identified counterparts and the spectral properties of the sources. By cross-matching the positions of the sources in the final catalog with the positions of the sources in the 4FGL catalog, we can establish associations and determine the types of the sources. The association with the 4FGL catalog allows us to classify the sources in the final catalog into different types, such as pulsars, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), supernova remnants (SNRs), and others. The types of the associated sources provide valuable insights into the nature and origin of the gamma-ray emission. To determine the association of sources observed by DAMPE with sources in the Fermi-LAT’s 4FGL catalog, we calculate the angular separations between the positions of the DAMPE sources and the positions of the 4FGL sources. The nearest source in the 4FGL catalog within a certain separation threshold is considered as the association of the DAMPE source. There are four sources that have a separation distance larger than 0.5◦ between the sources observed by DAMPE and their associations in 4FGL. Figure 4 provides a visual representation of the types and spatial distribution of the gamma-ray sources observed by DAMPE, offering insights into the diversity and distribution of these sources in the sky. Figure 5 displays the separations distribution between sources observed by DAMPE and thesociations in the 4FGL catalog. Table 1 presents the types of sources observed by DAMPE, along with the corresponding numbers of each type. According to Table 1, DAMPE has observed 175 AGNs, 46 pulsars, 10 SNRs/PWNs, 6 binary systems, and 11 unassociated sources.
