Finally, in light of the recent work (Goyal et al., 2022) that points to the misalignment of existing evaluation metrics with human preference in evaluating zeroshot summaries generated by LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), we study the effectiveness of ICE in evaluating zero-shot summaries generated by GPT-3. We find that ICE evaluations agree closely with human judgments on such summaries.
