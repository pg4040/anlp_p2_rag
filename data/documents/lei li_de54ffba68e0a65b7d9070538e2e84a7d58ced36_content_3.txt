In our study, risk model genes had a strong negative correlation with M0 macrophages and a strong positive correlation with B cells, which has proven the finding of Zhu [69]. A large number of studies have proven that HLA family genes are closely related to immunotherapy. HLA genes are essential for T lymphocyte activation and antigen presentation [70]. Low HLA-E expression is associated with better overall survival in endometrial cancer [71]. This study found that among the 24 HLA family genes, except HLAG, HLA-L, HLA-B, and HLA-A, the remaining genes were significantly differentially expressed between the high- and low-risk groups. Immune checkpoint blockade shows better therapeutic response in many tumor treatments [72]. We therefore analyzed the differential expression of immune checkpoints between the high-risk and low-risk groups. Except for HAVCR2, other immune checkpoints were differentially expressed between the high- and low-risk groups. Our findings suggest that BRCA may be particularly sensitive to combination checkpoint blockade therapy. Studies have shown that high LAG3 expression can induce EGFR-TKI and gefitinib resistance, as well as anti-PD-1 therapy resistance [73]. There are also studies, suggesting that ICOS activation may enhance the effects of inhibitory checkpoint blockade [74]. Ostroumov et al. [75] identified TIGIT as a potential target of immune checkpoint combination therapy by transcriptome analysis. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that cancer cells expressing CD274 may have an impact on regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment [76]. PDCD1 is closely associated with TMB, MSI, and immune cell infiltration, and can be used as a prognostic marker in various cancers [77]. A new finding suggested that IDO1 promotes GC metastasis and may be a promising target for GC anticancer therapy [78]. Hence, these immune checkpoints may offer new directions for breast cancer treatment. Finally, we examined the mRNA expression levels of m1A-related genes in breast cancer tissues and normal breast tissues. Except for CD1C, other genes had lower mRNA levels in tumor tissues than in normal tissues. Studies have discovered that over-expression of MEOX2 promoted apoptosis through inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway in laryngeal cancer cells [79]. A study by Feiyu Mao et al. demonstrated that high expression of COL17A1 is a marker for predicting
