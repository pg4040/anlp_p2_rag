To analyze the mechanism of the emergence of the nonreciprocal excitation, let us consider how the excitation from the hedgehog ground state propagates in the 1/1 AC. First, for comparison, let us consider the collinear FM ordered state in one dimensional lattice shown in Fig. 5A where the magnetic moment with the total angular momentum J = 6 is aligned to the z direction and the lattice is formed along the transverse direction, which is set as the x axis. Namely, |J = 6, Jz = 6� is realized at each site, which is denoted as |Jz�i , i.e., |6�i hereafter. Then, let us consider the excited state created at the ith site, H N P N H N P N BA 0 578.8 520.9 463.0 405.2 347.3 289.4 231.5 173.6 115.8 57.88 /( SJ 1 ) /( SJ 1 ) Figure 4.
