twice, 20 min each time. After freeze-drying at -80 ℃, the bacteria suspension was made with ethanol and added dropwise to the silicon wafer to observe the morphological difference of bacteria. 2.8. Photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism research Page 6/31 In order to further explore the photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials, radical scavenging experiments were carried out. S. aureus was used as a model bacterium to study the active substances that play a major role in the photocatalytic antibacterial process. During the experiment, different free radical scavengers were added to remove the generated ROS. BQ, IPA, Na2C2O4 and K2Cr2O7 were used as scavengers of •O2−, •OH, h+ and e−, respectively. 2.9. Application of composite photocatalytic materials in livestock and poultry wastewater In order to test the antibacterial properties of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material in practical application, the livestock and poultry sewage from the farm was selected as the real water sample to verify the ability of the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material to remove and kill bacteria in practical application. The BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material was added to the centrifuged and diluted livestock and poultry sewage of the farm, treated with LED light, and then 100 µL was taken out and spread on a solid LB plate for 24 h. The antibacterial effect was also evaluated by colony counting method. 3. Results And Discussion 3.1. Structure and morphology characterizations Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic materials with different molar ratios. The crystal structures of BiSnSbO6, ZnO and BiSnSbO6-ZnO were characterized by XRD. In the ZnO spectrum, the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 31.1°, 34.0°, 35.6°, 47.0°, 56.0°, 62.3° and 67.5° correspond to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) crystal planes, the same as the ZnO standard card (PDF#01-0562), are wurtzite hexagonal phases (V. Kononenko et al. 2017; A. Sundararaj et al. 2017). The characteristic diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 29.4°, 34.0°, 48.9°, 58.0°, 60.8° and 71.8° correspond to (222), (400), (440), (622), (444) and (800) of BiSnSbO6 diffraction crystal plane, which is consistent with the literature report (J. F. Luan et al. 2018). Compared with the characteristic peaks at the molar ratios of 1:2 and 1:3, the characteristic peaks of the composites with the molar ratios of 1:4 and 1:5 are clearer and sharper, indicating that the composites with the molar ratios of 1:4 and 1:5 have higher crystallinity. In the spectrum of BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite photocatalytic material, both the characteristic peaks of BiSnSbO6 and ZnO appeared, which indicated that the BiSnSbO6-ZnO composite
