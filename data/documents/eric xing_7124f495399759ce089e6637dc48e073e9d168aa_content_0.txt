D.1. Annotation In this section, we explain the implementation of our point cloud labeling in more detail. We leveraged a professional labeling program that has multiple annotating tools such as a brush, a polygon tool, a bounding volume tool, as well as different filtering methods for hiding labeled points or selected labels. Corresponding 2D images are displayed to assist labelling. The program also supports cross-checking and correction as illustrated in the main paper. Fig. 5 shows the interface of our point cloud annotation program. D.2. Semantic class definition In the process of labeling such challenging data, we had to decide which classes we wanted to annotate at some point in time. In general, we followed the class definitions of the SemanticKITTI dataset [2] and ACDC [37] dataset, but did some simplifications and adjustments for the data source used. The annotated classes with their respective definitions are listed in Table 19 below.
