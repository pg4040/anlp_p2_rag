Section: D Estimating Wikipedia Page Counts
As mentioned in §2.3, we used the "Total pages" count from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ List_of_Wikipedias, accessed 7 August 2023, as a proxy for the resource level of a language (refered to as wiki_ct in §3.4). We had to make some decisions regarding macrolanguage and microlanguage matches when making these estimates. Many of the languages in FLORES-200 (Team et al., 2022) are in fact microlanguages of a macrolangauge not included in the dataset. In some cases this microlanguage was did not have a listed Wikipedia page count, so we used the macrolanguage page count instead. Table 12 lists all the languages for which we used the Wikipedia page count of a macrolanguage (with a different ISO 639-3 code), based on our best judgment. In every case this was because the FLORES-200 microlanguage was not listed. There were also cases where we decided to list zero for a microlanguage’s wiki_ct, even if its macrolanguage was listed with a nonzero number of pages. This was in cases where we could reasonably assume that the macrolanguage’s Wikipedia pages were likely (either all or predominantly) in another microlanguage or dialect. We list the languages that we considered in this manner in Table 13. We also made some decisions regarding wiki_ct assignment based on the script of a language. We recorded zero Wikipedia pages for kas_Deva and 13,210 for kas_Arab (all of the Kashmiri pages) because a majority of Kashmiri pages seem to be in Perso-Arabic script. (There may be a few in Devanagari, but we simplify by assuming none are.) We also recorded zero pages for mni_Beng because, although Wikipedia has pages in Meitei, they appear to be in the Meitei Mtei script, not Bengali Beng. Lastly, we assigned Wikipedia’s count for ‘Classical Chinese’ (zh-classical) to zho_Hant and its count for ‘Chinese’ to zho_Hans (though it is possible that some of the ‘Chinese’ pages may be in the Traditional Chinese (Hant) script). In all other cases, if a language did not have a listed number of Wikipedia pages, we took this to mean it had zero.
