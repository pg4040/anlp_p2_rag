Title: Phosphorus Availability Affects the Photosynthesis and Antioxidant System of Contrasting Low-P-Tolerant Cotton Genotypes
Year: 2023
Abstract: Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and an important component of plant metabolism. However, little is known about the effects of low P availability on P absorption, the photosynthetic electron transport chain, and the antioxidant system in cotton. This study used cotton genotypes (sensitive FJA and DLNTDH and tolerant BX014 and LuYuan343) with contrasting low-P tolerance in a hydroponic experiment under 15 µM, 50 µM, and 500 μM P concentrations. The results showed that low P availability reduced plant development and leaf area, shoot length, and dry weight in FJA and DLNADH, compared to BX014 and LuYuan343. The low P availability decreased the gas-exchange parameters such as the net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance, and increased the intercellular CO2 concentration. Chlorophyll a fluorescence demonstrated that the leaves’ absorption and trapped-energy flux were largely steady. In contrast, considerable gains in absorption and trapped-energy flux per reaction center resulted from decreases in the electron transport per reaction center under low-P conditions. In addition, low P availability reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased the content of malondialdehyde in the cotton genotypes, especially in FJA and DLNTDH. Moreover, low P availability reduced the activity of PEPC and generated a decline in the content of ATP and NADPH. Our research can provide a theoretical physiological basis for the growth and tolerance of cotton under low-P conditions.
