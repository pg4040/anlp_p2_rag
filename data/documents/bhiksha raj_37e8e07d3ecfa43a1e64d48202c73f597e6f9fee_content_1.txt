different masking ratios of m ∈ [0, 1]C×Lt (calculated as 1− sum(m)C×Lt ). Small masking ratios cannot provide enough perturbation to the inputs while large ratios may lose the semantics to the target object. We find a masking ratio of 0.1 is a good trade-off as shown in Table 5c. (4) We ablate the amplitude of noise δ added as a semantic jitter in Table 5d. We notice that an amplitude of 0.5 leads to the best performance. Noise category. We conduct an experiment to investigate the impact of different noise categories. We additionally synthesize noisy speech queries by mixing clean speech from AVOS test set with different categories of audio recordings from Audioset (Gemmeke et al., 2017). As shown in Fig. 6, we illustrate the results of queries with different noise categories. We notice that sustained and loud noises, e.g., ambulance siren, can lead to a severe performance drop compared to short-lived and faint noises, e.g., horse clip-clop.
