learning rates along both task dimension and parameter dimension compared with GradNorm that only do loss re-weighting. Adaptive Learning. We consider variations of the main version of adaptive learning which is applied only in the last ANCE episode. Specifically, we investigate the impact of applying adaptive learning to the last four ANCE episodes using an exponential softmax temperature decay scheduler. This approach yields an average page-level Rprecision of 73.47%. In comparison, when adaptive learning is applied only to the last ANCE episode, we achieve an average page-level Rprecision of 73.74%. These results suggest that extending adaptive learning to more ANCE episodes does not yield improvement. Additionally, we examine the effectiveness of encouraging task specialization within adaptive learning. For this purpose, we focus on the second ANCE episode and experiment with positive softmax temperature (encouraging task specialty) and negative softmax temperature (discouraging task specialty). Encouraging task specialization results in an average page-level R-precision of 70.53%, while discouraging task specialization leads to an average pagelevel R-precision of 68.39%. In comparison, the performance of the standard multitask baseline at the second ANCE episode is 69.28%. These results highlight the benefits of encouraging task specialization and the detrimental effect of discouraging task specialization within adaptive learning. Normalizing task sensitivity using the median is preferred over using the mean or not applying any normalization, as different tasks exhibit variations in magnitude while sharing similar distribution shapes (see Figure 2).
