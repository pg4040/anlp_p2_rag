Welcome 
Welcome to Carnegie Mellon University!  Being in the CMU School of Computer Science (SCS) 
is a unique experience because of the size of the school (over 2000 students, staff and faculty), 
the quality of its members, the variety of research being conducted, and unparalleled learning 
opportunities.  We encourage you to take advantage of CMU offerings, both inside and outside 
SCS, and also to explore Pittsburgh and southwest Pennsylvania to the extent your schedule 
permits.   What you will find is an environment that encourages and rewards hard work and 
accomplishment.  Pittsburgh has long been an industrial area whose residents build things.  In 
SCS we build things, and you will also.  
While this handbook is specific to your academic experience in the MSAII program, there are 
several other resources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during their 
tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, the student handbook, the 
Office of Graduate and Postdoc Affairs, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and others are 
included in Appendix A of this handbook. 
2 Mission, Vision and Philosophy 
Carnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society through continual 
innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship. 
Our mission is to create a transformative educational experience for students focused on deep 
disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; teamwork, leadership, communication, and 
interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-being. 
The university community is committed to (a) attracting and retaining diverse, world-class 
talent; (b) creating a collaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, in which 
research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and (c) ensuring individuals 
can achieve their full potential. 
We encourage our members to impact society in a transformative way — regionally, nationally, 
and globally — by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the university 
campus.  See the full university mission statement. 
3 Carnegie Mellon Statement of Assurance 
Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration 
of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or 
disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status 
or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate and is 
required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state or local laws or executive orders. 
7 
 
Inquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed 
to the university ombudsperson, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 
PA 15213, telephone 412-268-1018. Obtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University 
by calling 412-268-2000. 
Carnegie Mellon University publishes an annual campus security and fire safety report 
describing the university's security, alcohol and drug, sexual assault and fire safety policies, and 
containing statistics about the number and type of crimes committed on the campus, and the 
number and cause of fires in campus residence facilities during the preceding three years. You 
can obtain a copy by contacting the Carnegie Mellon Police Department at 412-268-2323. The 
annual security and fire safety report also is available online at 
www.cmu.edu/police/annualreports.. 
Information regarding the application of Title IX, including to admission and employment 
decisions, the sexual misconduct grievance procedures and process, including how to file a 
report or a complaint of sex discrimination, how to file a report of sexual harassment, and how 
the university responds to such reports is available at www.cmu.edu/title-ix. The Title IX 
coordinator may be reached at 4615 Forbes Ave, Suite 330, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; 412-268-7125; or 
tix@cmu.edu. 
4 Carnegie Mellon Code 
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to 
the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical 
and moral conduct possible. 
These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as 
well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above 
the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept. 
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the 
standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is 
rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect 
the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. 
The discovery, advancement, and communication of knowledge are not possible without a 
commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the 
creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. 
Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community 
cannot exist. 
The commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high 
respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by 
8 
 
their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily 
withdraw from the university. 
The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found online. 
5 University Policies and Expectations

8 MSAII Policies 
The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) has prepared this statement of policies, program 
requirements, guidance, process and procedures for students in the M.S. in Artificial Intelligence 
and Innovation (MSAII) program. A copy of this handbook is also available online at the 
program website.   
The University Student guide, The Word, which details university-wide policies, is also 
available online at www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword.     
Additional resources specific to graduate students can be found at 
www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/    
8.1 The MSAII Degree 
The M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) is a professional master's program 
offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) in the School of Computer Science at 
Carnegie Mellon University. This program seeks to educate students in the innovative use of 
artificial intelligence to create practical solutions in a wide variety of application areas. As 
artificial intelligence matures, there is a great need for students who can envision, design, plan 
and deliver solutions that integrate AI technologies such as deep learning, natural language 
processing, robotics and big data analytics into new applications.  The program stresses both 
10 
 
intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship and encourages students to develop ideas for startups 
and for introduction into established companies. 
The curriculum is designed for students who have a strong background in computer science 
with interest in in-depth study of AI to enable them to develop real-world applications, 
especially in areas to which AI has not yet been applied. The integrated curriculum includes 
coursework and team projects leading to a full-semester capstone project to produce a working 
prototype.

8.3 The Reasonable Person Principle (RPP) 
It is a long-standing and revered principle of the School of Computer Science (SCS) that 
members of our community are expected to act reasonably, and therefore we try to keep formal, 
written SCS policies to a minimum.  The faculty do not burden the students with numerous 
rules, and, in return, we expect the students to not try to find technical loopholes that violate 
the clear intent of program policies.  In any situation not covered by an explicit rule, you should 
ask yourself how reasonable people would behave in that situation.  The RPP does not alter 
University-wide policies. 
8.4 Academic Calendar 
11 
 
The Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html and 
provides information on all deadlines including registration dates, class start dates, add/drop 
deadlines, exam dates and more. 
9 The Language Technologies Institute 
9.1 Working Space for MS Students 
Except for restrictions due to COVID, full-time students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the 
Pittsburgh campus have access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and 
provide space for working when on campus. 
9.2 Photocopies and Printers 
Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental resources are located in GHC 5404 
The use of a photocopier requires only a CMU ID card.  The School of Computer Science 
provides a number of black-and-white and color printers for use by students.  The SCS 
Computer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at 
https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printing.  When you send a file to the print queue, you 
may go to any of the listed printers, swipe your CMU ID, and the file will be printed on that 
printer. 
9.3 Computers for MS Students 
Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access 
university resources and complete course assignments.  Laptops running Windows, MacOS, and 
Linux software are all acceptable. 
MS students will be given a CS user id.  A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, 
department printers, and other SCS services.  The School of Computer Science has a Help 
Center located at 4203 GHC.  They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, extension 8-4231 from 
a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line. 
MS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used 
for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project.  The LTI cluster 
provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or lengthy 
computation.  
12 
 
10 Degree Requirements 
MSAII students are expected to complete their degree requirements within five consecutive semesters, 
fall, spring, summer internship, second fall, second spring.  Under exceptional conditions, such as for 
medical reasons, a student may be granted a leave of absence.  See Section 11.1.10, below.   Upon 
completion of the graduate program degree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s 
academic program in the semester in which the student completes the requirements. 
10.1 Course Grade and GPA Requirements   
To receive the M.S. degree, all students must take and successfully complete at least 195 units 
of coursework. All required Core Courses must be completed with a grade of B or better. For 
the Knowledge Area Courses, students must maintain a B average.  No grade lower than C (or 
Pass in the case of Pass/No Pass courses) shall be used for credit applied toward graduation.  
Under SCS policy, only a grade of C or higher will be regarded as a Pass in a Pass/No Pass 
course.  No undergraduate courses count toward the 195-unit requirement. 
All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order: 
 Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) – No prerequisite. 
 AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or 
better. 
 LTI Practicum (11-935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship. 
 AI Innovation (11-654) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-695 with a grade of “B” or 
better. 
 Capstone (11-699) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-654 with a grade of “B” or better.  
Students are required to repeat any required course that they have completed with a grade less 
than the required minimum, preferably at the next offering. (Please note that Core courses and 
Knowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Students will be allowed to retake a required 
course only once. If a student fails in the second attempt, he or she will be dropped from the 
MSAII program.    
If a student fails an elective course, she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute 
course (equivalent course approved by the Director).    
All grades count towards the program QPA, except for repeated courses, in which case the final 
grade replaces the previous grade.  Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student’s QPA.  
However, ONLY ELECTIVE COURSES MAY BE TAKEN PASS/NO PASS, unless the Provost 
directs to the contrary.  Students who do not achieve the required minimum grade in a required 
course, who elect to take an “incomplete” in a required course, or whose cumulative grade point 
average is below a B (3.0), will be placed on academic probation. Students on probation are not 
eligible to graduate. Students who are placed on academic probation shall receive written  
notice of this finding, including a list of measures that need to be taken to be removed from 
13 
 
academic probation. A student on academic probation for two consecutive semesters may be 
dropped from the program.    
The MSAII program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in 
order to monitor individual student progress toward graduation. Should a student’s effort fall 
below the acceptable academic performance and/or fail to meet the standards established by the 
MSAII program and Carnegie Mellon University, the student may be dismissed from the 
program. 
Should a student’s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, he/she will be placed 
on academic probation for the following semester and will be required to improve his/her grades 
to no less than overall 3.0 QPA during that period. Failure to improve to an overall 3.0 QPA or 
better the following semester may result in termination from the program. In addition, a student 
who violates policies established by Carnegie Mellon University may be dismissed from the 
program. 
After each academic progress review, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the 
result of the review. Warning letters are issued for the following cases: 
1) Overall QPA below 3.0 (Academic probation) 
2) Semester QPA is below 3.0 
3) Grade below B in a Core course 
4) Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) according to the university policies.  This includes any 
AIV letter received in during the summer preceding matriculation. 
A student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances: 
a) A student who has received two Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will be 
terminated.  There are no exceptions and the Program Director has no discretion over 
such a termination as it is an LTI policy. 
b) A student who has received one Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may be 
terminated by the Program Director if the violation is so serious that the student cannot 
be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program. 
c) A student has received three warning letters of any type from the MSAII program. 
d) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is 
provided. 
An AIV letter or violation of University Policy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal 
procedures.  See Section 4.5.2, below.  However, a decision to terminate a student after appeal 
because of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable. 
10.2 Course Requirements  
14 
 
1) Summer Before Entrance  
Admitted students are required to take, pay for, and pass 15-513 Introduction to 
Computer Systems OR 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science during the 
summer prior to their arrival at Carnegie Mellon.  The units earned in these courses are 
not counted toward the total number of units required for graduation.  These courses 
may be taken pass/no pass, but cannot be dropped.  A student who drops either course 
during the summer will not be permitted to begin the degree program in the fall, but 
must retake one of the courses the following summer.  The MSAII course offerings are 
available at msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum.  The university’s complete Schedule of 
Classes can be found at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search. 
Students are then required to take and successfully complete the courses below: 
2) The Core Courses (87 units) - Must be taken in THIS SEQUENCE: 
 
11-651 – AI & Future Markets – (12 units). First Fall semester.   Only open to MSAII.  
 
17-762 – Law of Computer Technology (12 units). First Fall semester 
 
11-695 – AI Engineering (12 units). First Spring semester 
  
11-935 – LTI Practicum (3 units).  Summer Internship 
 
11-654 – AI Innovation (12 units). Second Fall semester.  Only open to MSAII. 
 
11-699 – Capstone Project (36 units). Second Spring semester.  Only open to MSAII.     
 
3) The Knowledge Area Courses (72 units):  
 
11-601, Coding Bootcamp (12 units).  First fall semester. 
 
10-601, Machine Learning (12 units), First fall semester. (Normally    
      11-691, Math for Machine Learning, which is not being offered in Fall 2022.) 
 
10-605, Machine Learning with Large Datasets (12 units).  First spring semester. 
 
11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units).  Second fall semester. 
 
11-785, Deep Learning (12 units).  Second spring semester. 
 
One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student’s choice (with approval of the 
Program Director) 
In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a 
similar degree of difficulty may be substituted with the permission of the Director. If a 
15 
 
student has already taken an equivalent course and shows proficiency in the subject 
area, a more advanced course in the area may be taken in place of these required 
courses with permission of the Director.  Graduate students cannot receive credit for 
undergraduate courses.       
 
4) Electives:  
A minimum of 36 units of SCS courses must be taken.  It is recommended to take one 
elective in the first fall semester, one or two in the first spring semester, one or two in 
the second fall semester and zero or one in the second spring semester.  The courses 
below are automatically approved.  A student who wants to take a course not listed 
must obtain approval of the Director prior to registering.  In general, the Director will 
approve any graduate SCS course of not more than 12 units.  It is also possible to seek 
approval for courses in other Colleges at CMU.  However, those courses must be 
rationally related to an AI career in order to be approved as electives.  
11-636 MSAII Independent Study (may be taken ONCE as an elective unless permission 
of the Director is obtained) 
11-641 Machine Learning for Text Mining 
11-642 Search Engines 
11-676 Big Data Analytics 
11-747 Neural Networks for NLP

16 
 
02-604 Fundamentals of Bioinformatics 
02-718 Computational Medicine 
 
Independent study (11-636) is encouraged.  The process is that you find a faculty 
member willing to supervise your independent study, assign a number of credits not to 
exceed 12, and assign a grade at the end of the study.  The faculty member must send 
an email to the Director indicating such willingness.  You can then register for 11-636. 
 
Courses carrying more than 12 units in a semester are NOT APPROVED as electives.  
 
Students may take athletics or music or theatrical performance courses that do not 
require work outside of class times.  However, such courses will NOT count toward 
the 195 units required for graduation. 
10.2.1 Incomplete Grades  
Carnegie Mellon University students are expected to complete a course during the academic 
semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of “I” 
(incomplete) may be given when a student has been unable to complete the work of a course. 
However, the work completed up to that date must be of passing quality and the grade of 
incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students.  
By awarding an “I” grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for the completion of the 
work and designate a default letter grade in the event that the student fails to complete the 
remaining work.  
Students must complete the required course work by no later than the end of the following 
academic semester or sooner if required by the instructor.  
The instructor must record the permanent course grade by the last day of the examination 
period of the following semester, or the Registrar will automatically assign the default grade.  
If further work has not been completed after one semester and a default grade is rendered, the 
default grade will become the grade of record. 
10.2.2 Change of grades and missing grades  
If a grade has been assigned in error, it can be changed to a different permanent grade. The 
procedure for changing a grade is as follows: 
 Discuss the matter with the course instructor; provide evidence that the grade issued was 
not the grade earned. 
17 
 
 If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the program administrator to process 
a Change of Grade Form in order to correct the grade that was issued in error. Generally, 
the instructor is the final authority for a course grade. 
 If a grade has not been assigned, please notify the course instructor for the completion of 
a Missing Grade Form. 
10.2.3 Transferring to another program  
A student may withdraw from the MSAII program at any time.  If any requirement for the 
MSAII degree has not been met, the degree will not be awarded.  Occasionally, students are 
accepted into a different degree program at CMU and transfer to that program.  International 
students who do this should check with OIE to ensure that their visa is not jeopardized. 
10.2.4 Intellectual Property Policy 
See http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html. 
10.2.5 Teaching Requirements 
None.  Students who wish to do so may apply for teaching assistant positions for courses in 
which they have excelled.  It is important to ensure that the student’s academic responsibilities 
are not adversely impacted by a TAship, and vice-versa. 
10.3 Advising   
10.3.1 Student Advising  
Every MSAII student will be assigned an advisor, normally the Program Director.  Before the 
course registration period each semester, students must meet with their advisor to discuss their 
course selection. New students will be given instructions to register for their classes during the 
summer prior to entrance.    
10.3.2 Monitoring Progress  
The advisor meets with the student at least twice a year, providing guidance and monitoring the 
student’s overall progress.   
10.3.3 Degree Certification  
Students who graduate having met all the requirements for the degree will receive a diploma 
stating that they have received a “Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation.” 
18 
 
10.4 Internship   
Students must obtain an internship during the summer between the first and second years of the 
program.  This is a requirement.  An internship will provide students with the opportunity to 
apply the knowledge and technical skills learned during the first year of the program, to gain 
insight into AI and future market needs to further their experience and develop a strong context 
for the second-year concentration coursework.  Normally the internship will be with an outside 
company.  In some circumstances, a student who is doing research with a CMU faculty member 
during the summer may request that such research qualify as an internship. 
The internship must involve at least two months of full-time work and must relate to computer 
software development and is preferably AI-related. 
Students are encouraged to intern with an organization that corresponds to their individual area 
of interest and career goals.   
All students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI 
Practicum).  This course can be taken once during the program with Pass/Fail and will be 
counted toward graduation units.  International students must apply for Curricular Practical 
Training (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE).  To 
obtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling out employment dates, work hours, and wages 
or stipend.  It is the student’s responsibility in 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester 
following the internship to all current MSAII students detailing the student’s internship 
experience. 
International students who are interested in working in the U.S after graduation are required to 
consult with the Office of International Education (OIE) which oversees the OPT registration.  
Note: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon. 
NOTE: Students are personally responsible for securing a suitable internship.  The Career and 
Professional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and 
internship opportunity listings in Handshake.  We strongly suggest students begin the 
internship search beginning in the Fall of your first year. Some internship opportunities have 
application deadlines in the Fall, so by starting your search early, you won't miss out on these 
internships.  The Career and Professional Development Center will assist students with the 
internship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is the 
students’ responsibility.   
The following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome.  Many of the 
events below have been modified due to COVID. 
September/October  
 Meet with your advisor to discuss your interests and plan your internship search.  
19 
 
 Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally 
with second-year students who can offer first-hand information about their internships.  
 Attend the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure 
to potential employers for internships.   
November/December  
 Begin researching organizations and internship opportunities. Pay close attention to 
organizations that have established internship programs and their deadlines.  
 Attend workshops to perfect your resume, hone your interviewing skills, and gain 
knowledge about the internship search process.  
January/February  
 At this point, you should have a “short list” of organizations at which you would like to 
intern. This list can include organizations that have established internship programs as 
well as those that interest you without formal internship programs. 
 Update your resume with relevant academic projects, coursework, etc. 
 Begin utilizing your network for internship leads as well as checking organization’s 
websites for internships.  
 Make contact with employers, sending resumes and applications, and initiating internship 
interviews in person or by phone.  
 Attend Network Nights and talk to alumni about internship opportunities in their 
organization. They are an excellent resource for learning more about a particular 
organization, career field or employment opportunity. You can find alumni in the Alumni 
Directory, Alumni Career Advisor Network, and Carnegie Mellon Alumni LinkedIn 
Network.  
March/April  
 At this point, you should have secured an internship or be interviewing with various 
organizations.  
 Prepare a backup plan if your first choices of internships do not work out. 
 Attend relevant Network Nights and Career Fairs at Carnegie Mellon.  
 If you are an F-1 Visa student, you must apply for CPT.  
 MSAII students should enroll in 11-935 for three units. You will not have to pay tuition for 
this course.   
10.5 Employment Eligibility Verification  
If you are receiving compensation or a stipend from CMU, if you are going to be a TA or you are 
planning to seek a position with CMU, then Employment Eligibility Verification is required.  
Form I-9 must be completed within 3 business days of beginning work for any type of 
compensation (stipend or employment). Additional details are highlighted below. 
20 
 
To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment 
Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf] covering the university’s I-9 and E-Verify requirements:  
Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 
Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days following the first day of stipend 
start date/employment.  
Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for 
submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources.  
For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify 
Requirements at CMU [pdf], or visit the Human Resources Service website to learn more about 
Form I-9 and E-Verify and to schedule an appointment to complete the Form I-9. 
10.6 MSAII Orientation  
Each Fall semester, the MSAII program provides a program orientation to help new students 
learn about the program. All new students are required to attend them and treat them seriously 
because they explain the program sequence, its Core and Knowledge courses requirements and 
how students will meet the program learning outcomes.  
10.7 End of Semester Evaluation 
The MSAII program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each semester in 
order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation. Should a student’s effort fall 
below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to meet the standards 
established by the MSAII program, the student may be dismissed from the program. 
After each academic progress review, a student may receive one or more letters, indicating the 
result of the review. See Section 3.1, Course Grade and GPA Requirements, above. 
At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluates each student's academic progress. If a student 
seems to be having trouble, the faculty determines whether it believes that the student can 
finish the degree, and if so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of 
letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent "black mark" on the 
student's record; if the student begins making satisfactory progress again, there is no official 
record of the letter in the student's transcript. 
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the student a letter that specifies a list of conditions 
that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines. Failure to meet all of the specified conditions 
may result in the student's termination from the program. 
21 
 
10.8 Enrollment Verification 
Enrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of enrollment, 
official transcript, and enrollment verification.  Enrollment verification can be requested online 
through The HUB at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/.  
10.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading 
10.9.1 University Policy on Grades 
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html 
 
This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses 
and covers the specifics of assigning and changing grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, 
and course repeats.  It also defines the undergraduate and graduate grading standards. 
10.9.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses & PCHE 
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-
assignment.html  
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a 
cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-
registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. 
The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: 
Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program 
will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will 
be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken but without a grade. Such 
courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: 
Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only 
if their college’s and department's policies allow this.)  
The MSAII program does not accept transfer credit for courses taken prior to matriculation at 
Carnegie Mellon. 
The MSAII program does not accept distance education credits except for distance courses 
offered by Carnegie Mellon or PCHE institutions. 
10.10 Academic Integrity 
Carnegie Mellon’s Academic Integrity policy is posted at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. All students 
22 
 
are expected to be familiar with this policy, including the university-wide protocol for handling 
academic integrity violations.  The policy includes the University expectations around academic 
integrity and provides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.  
A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures 
(https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html) is also 
recommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and 
adjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures also 
outline the appeal process. 
It is an absolute requirement that the work you submit must be your own, unless you 
specifically identify the source of any material that is not yours.  This includes quotations and 
material from websites.  In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any 
person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that work.  Any student who violates 
the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in 
suspension or expulsion under University policies.  THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE 
FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE 
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.   
You are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them 
as your own work.  Any copied material MUST appear in quotation marks or italics and MUST 
be accompanied by a citation to the original source.  Failure to do this violates CMU’s Policy on 
Academic Integrity, which states, “In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources 
is required. … Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other 
individuals without proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another 
source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be 
graded.” 
It is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to 
provide your work to others to assist them.  Because team deliverables are the product of joint 
work, it is the responsibility of each member of a team to ensure that all team materials have 
been produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given for work that is not a 
student’s own. Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying 
material from the Internet without indicating its source, then no one on the team can receive 
credit for that work, even if only one student is directly guilty of violating the policy. 
We are aware that acts that constitute cheating can be viewed very differently in different 
countries and cultures.  However, Carnegie Mellon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect 
U.S. culture.  Employers expect that students who graduate from Carnegie Mellon have 
obtained their degree legitimately and according to Carnegie Mellon policies.  If you have any 
doubt whether proposed conduct would be considered cheating under Carnegie Mellon policies, 
ASK A FACULTY MEMBER OR THE DIRECTOR FIRST.   
23 
 
All violations of the Academic Integrity policy MUST be reported to the University 
administration by the faculty members involved.  Copies go to the Program Director, the Head of 
the Language Technology Institute, the Associate Dean for Master’s Programs, and various 
officials at Warner Hall.   The faculty do not have the option to decline to make a report.  The 
offending student will receive an email to inform them of an Academic Integrity Violation (AIV). 
The email will specify the offense and the penalty, and will inform the student of available 
appeal procedures. An AIV that is successfully appealed is erased. 
Important note:  The university policy gives a department the option of “conven[ing] a 
disciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program.”  The LTI has a 
“two strikes” rule.  The LTI may terminate a student for a first violation, depending upon the 
circumstances and severity of the violation.  The LTI always terminates a student for a second 
violation, with no exceptions. 
11 Academic Policies 
11.1 Course Registration    
11.1.1 Status 
All Students must be registered for at least 48 units during each semester. Any questions about 
registration should be directed to the Enrollment Services (the HUB). Note that International 
students are required to be registered as full-time students, minimum 36 units.   
11.1.2 Academic Calendar  
The Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/.   All dates about 
registration, add/drop deadlines, university holidays and more can be found there.    
11.1.3 Online Registration  
All new students will register for required courses in April after accepting admission and 
receiving an Andrew ID. After that, students will register following the schedule set by the 
HUB. Note that students must meet with their advisor to obtain approval for their course 
selection. Registration information is available at 
www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/index.html.  Online registration is done with an 
Andrew ID at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/sio/about.html.   
Students must register for at least 48 units per semester.   
24 
 
11.1.4 Double-Dipping 
An MSAII student who applies courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie 
Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those same courses toward 
any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval. 
11.1.5 Pass/No Pass Courses (Pass/Fail) 
With the approval of the Program Director, a graduate student may choose to take one 
ELECTIVE course pass/no pass. Core courses and Knowledge courses may not be taken pass/no 
pass.  By the deadline for changing a course to pass/no pass, the student must fill out the 
Pass/No Pass Approval Form and receive permission from their advisor. A pass/no pass election 
is irrevocable as a matter of CMU policy. (A form can be found at 
https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html) 
11.1.6 Auditing a Course  
With the approval of the Program Director, a graduate student may audit a course by obtaining 
the permission of the instructor or teaching department and completing the Course Audit 
Approval Form. Audited classes are not taken for credit and cannot be used to fulfill graduation 
requirements. (Audit form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html)  
11.1.7 Adding a Course  
During the ADD period of each semester (the first two weeks of the semester), students may add 
a course by registering online. After the ADD deadline, they may add a course by completing the 
Late Add Request form and obtaining the permission of both: 1) the instructor or teaching 
department and 2) their advisor. (Add form can be found at 
https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html)   
11.1.8 Dropping a Course  
Dropping courses is not recommended except for reasons of health or family emergency.  Many 
SCS courses have long waitlists, and dropping a course means that some other student who 
might have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability.  Also, if students 
in the MSAII program drop courses, then the instructors of those courses may no longer allow 
MSAIIs to enroll. 
Sometimes, however, a student’s workload can become unexpectedly heavy because of course 
requirements.  No one is expected to suffer from such pressure and dropping a course may 
become a necessity.  To avoid this unfortunate circumstance, you should inform yourself in 
advance of the curriculum and workload in each course you plan to take and ensure that you are 
capable of handling the load.  Note that CMU SCS courses are very difficult, and students who 
25 
 
may easily have handled taking five courses simultaneously at another institution may not be 
able to do so at CMU. 
Exact add, drop and withdrawal dates may be found on the official Academic Calendar. Up until 
the deadlines, students can initiate course adds and drops through Student Information Online 
(SIO). Courses dropped by the deadline will not appear on the student's record, and courses 
withdrawn from by the deadline will receive a 'W' grade. Additionally, a voucher process has 
been implemented for late drops. 
Students taking undergraduate and Master’s level courses must follow the procedures and 
deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic 
calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-
changes/index.html. 
Late Course Drops & Vouchers 
A late drop voucher system was implemented beginning with the fall 2018 semester to permit a 
limited number of late course drops. Master's students are permitted one drop voucher per year 
of study and may use only one voucher per semester (including summer).  Courses dropped 
using a voucher will be removed from the student's record, as long as the drop is confirmed in 
SIO by the student within 24 hours of receiving the automated voucher email (refer to 
instructions below). Students may use drop vouchers up until the last day of classes each 
semester.  These policies are spelled out at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-
changes/index.html. 
Note that the Core courses and some Knowledge courses are only offered once per year so 
dropping a course may delay program completion.  
Note: International students must maintain a minimum of 36 units (Full time) to meet the U.S. 
government’s visa requirement. Please check with the Office of International Education (OIE) 
for more information.   
11.1.9 Transfer Credits  
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and- 
assignment.html 
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a 
cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-
registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. 
The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows: 
Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program 
will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will 
be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such 
26 
 
courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: 
suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only 
if their college's and department's policies allow this.). 
The MSAII program does not accept transfer credits. 
11.1.10 Leave of Absence  
Students who need to delay their studies for personal, medical or academic reasons may do so 
with a leave of absence (leaving the university temporarily with a commitment to return). 
Students must contact the MSAII Director to discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate 
form.  The student’s place in the program will be held until a mutually determined time. For 
more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html. 
When planning to return from Leave of Absence students must complete the appropriate 
paperwork before returning to the University.   
MSAII students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree 
requirements are expected to remain in close contact with the program, and will be certified at 
the end of the semester in which they have completed their degree requirements. Students must 
refer to the CMU Policy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations 
(https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-
limitations.html) regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on the 
maximum length of time allowable for master’s degree completion and certification. 
11.1.11 Additional Guidance for Students   
Program of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree 
requirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.  
Financial aid and student account. Students are expected to make normal progress toward 
their degree in order to graduate within the standard timeframe for their program of study. 
Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent 
upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their 
current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they 
may be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward their 
current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree completion.)  
Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB regarding billing and 
financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-standard completion, or integrated 
undergraduate and master’s degree programs.  
International students. Immigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is 
tied to making normal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 
27 
 
students who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating longer-
than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate student classification 
(integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with their designated advisor in the 
Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure compliance with immigration regulations. 
11.1.12 Withdrawal   
Students who need to withdraw from the program (leave the university with no intention of 
returning) for personal, medical or academic reasons must contact the MSAII Director to 
discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form. For more information refer to 
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html.    
11.2 Tuition and Fees   
Information about tuition and fees is available at https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/index.html.  
MSAII students will pay tuition according to the rates set for the School of Computer Science.  
All tuition and fees must be paid in full by the due date; a student not in good financial standing 
will be dismissed from the program. Students taking summer courses must pay tuition.   
11.3 Graduation Ceremonies   
The University holds one Commencement ceremony in May of each year.  Only students who 
have completed their degree requirements may participate in Commencement. 
There are no August or December commencement ceremonies.  
11.3.1 Withdrawal of Degree 
A degree once conferred can be withdrawn by the University under certain circumstances.  See 
the Withdrawal of Degree Policy. 
11.4 LTI Academic Policies 
11.4.1 “Grandfather” policy 
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the 
program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are adopted 
after the student entered the program. If it is not realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, 
the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and 
typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period. 
28 
 
11.4.2 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption 
The LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses 
previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the program director, on 
the advice of the faculty member for whose course an exemption is sought. If a student is 
exempt from a required course due to prior courses or experience, the student can replace that 
course with an open elective. The student does not receive credit for the exempted course but 
can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student 
receives credit for prior coursework completed at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere, the student 
receives that many units of credit and the total amount of required coursework is reduced by 
that amount. 
11.4.3 Employment/Consulting 
Since consulting provides useful experience, students are generally permitted to consult at most 
one day per seven-day week, with the Program Director's consent.  International students must 
also have approval in advance from the Office of International Education (OIE) for any paid 
position.  Students may use their consulting time to perform unpaid work on research projects 
for CMU faculty for up to 10 hours per week. 
Students may serve as teaching assistants for CMU faculty.   TA work is inconsistent with 
research because of the necessary time commitment.  Students must choose one activity or the 
other, not both. 
Note that there is an English language proficiency requirement for TAs.  Graduate students are 
required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as 
required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990. Through this Act, all 
institutions of higher education in the state are required to evaluate and certify the English 
fluency of all instructional personnel, including teaching assistants and interns. The full 
university policy can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-
certification-english-fluency-instructors.html. 
11.4.4 Leave of Absence 
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA) since students usually do not return, despite 
having good intentions. However, a student in good standing may be granted a LOA of at most 
one year, upon written request to the MSAII Director and with the consent of the student's 
advisor. It is the responsibility of the student on LOA to contact the LTI to initiate a return to 
the program. 
Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university’s leave of 
absence process, which is described at www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-
life/student-leave.html. 
29 
 
11.4.5 Satisfactory Progress 
If a student does not make satisfactory progress each semester toward completing the degree, the 
LTI may remove the student from the program.  See section on “End of Semester Evaluation.” 
11.5 Carnegie Mellon Academic Policies 
11.5.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities 
The Office of Disability Resources at Carnegie Mellon University has a continued mission to 
provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the 
Carnegie Mellon community.  We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable 
accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Sections 503 
and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Students who would like to receive accommodations 
must submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to access@andrew.cmu.edu to begin the 
interactive accommodation process.   
For more information, please see https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/.Students with 
physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional disabilities are encouraged to self-identify with the 
Office of Disability Resources and request needed accommodations.  Any questions about the 
process can be directed to access@andrew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121. 
11.5.2 Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures 
Students who believe that they have been inappropriately treated are encouraged to raise their 
concern(s) with the Program Director, department head, or other designated person in their 
department, college, or central administration according to University policies.  No effort will be 
made to prevent or discourage anyone from availing themselves of such procedures (see 
Graduate Student Appeal and Procedures www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-
procedures.html). 
Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance 
Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource web page.   This document summarizes 
processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. 
Graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable 
department, unit or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution 
cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to 
follow the formal procedures outlined here.   These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply 
to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the department 
specific information in this handbook for department and college information about the 
administration and academic policies of the program.  Additionally, students may confer with 
30 
 
the Graduate Education Office (grad-ed@cmu.edu) on issues of process or other concerns as 
they navigate conflicts. 
11.5.3 Process for Appealing Final Grades 
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies/appeal-grievance-procedures.html.  
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of 
the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of 
the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who 
assigned the grade.  The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a 
grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error 
such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), 
or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University 
policy 
11.5.4 Safeguarding Educational Equity: 
Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault 
The University prohibits sex-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ 
domestic violence and stalking. The University also prohibits retaliation against individuals 
who bring forward such concerns or allegations in good faith.  The University’s Sexual 
Misconduct Policy is available at www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-
governance/sexual-harassment-and-sexual-assault.html.   If you believe you have been the victim 
of sexual harassment or sexual assault, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the 
following resources: 
 Office of Title IX Initiatives, http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/, 412-268-7125 
 Sexual Harassment Advisors, found in Appendix A of the Policy Against Sexual 
Harassment and Sexual Assault; 
 Survivor Support Network, found in Appendix B of the Policy Against Sexual 
Harassment and Sexual Assault; 
 Sexual Harassment Process and Title IX Coordinators, found in section II of the Policy 
Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault; 
 University Police, 412-268-2323 
 University Health Services, 412-268-2157 
 Counseling & Psychological Services, 412-268-2922 
31 
 
Additional resources and information can be found at:  https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-
and-information/resources.html. 
The University’s Policy Against Retaliation is available at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/whistleblower.html 
The MSAII program has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy on sexual harassment and sexual assault. 
If you are found to have violated Carnegie Mellon policy, you will be dropped from the MSAII 
program immediately without exception.  CMU has spent decades successfully developing a 
non-threatening environment for all genders and no one will be permitted to interfere with that 
accomplishment. 
Consensual Intimate Relationship Policy Regarding Undergraduate Students 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/consensual-relationships.html 
This policy is relevant for graduate students who will be in a supervisory role of undergraduate 
students as a TA or in a research lab/studio setting.  This policy addresses the circumstances in 
which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/interactions with undergraduate students, 
even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohibited. The purpose of this policy is to assure 
healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discourage consensual intimate 
relationships unless there is a conflicting professional relationship in which one party has 
authority over the other as in the policy. 
11.5.5 Cultural Tolerance 
The MSAII program is extremely diverse for a program of its size. We have students from 
numerous different countries who must work effectively in a team setting.  The students 
invariably come from very different cultures that have differing attitudes towards age, gender, 
and group interaction.  The program management understands this, but the students must also 
recognize that this program is being conducted in the United States and operates according to 
U.S. norms.  Students and faculty, regardless of background, age, or rank, must deal with each 
other respectfully without insult or raised voices.  It is impossible to conduct teamwork in any 
other way.  Violations will be dealt with harshly.  The Program Director is not sympathetic to 
such behavior, which will not be tolerated.  Repeated infractions, or a serious single infraction 
may result in termination from the program. 
11.5.6 Language Policy 
The MSAII program is a component of the Language Technologies Institute, which studies and 
celebrates the diversity of human language and forms of expression.  The LTI also recognizes the 
futility and unfairness of attempting to determine the language students must use when 
communicating.  However, it is unprofessional in any official team meeting to speak a language 
32 
 
that is not understood by all team members.  For example, if all members of a team understand 
Chinese, then they may use Chinese in team meetings.  However, if even one team member does 
not understand Chinese, then a language must be used that is understood by all team members.  
It is recommended that non-native speakers of English use English as much as possible if they 
intend to seek employment in an English-speaking country. 
11.5.7 Childbirth/Maternity Accommodation Protocol 
The Maternity Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-
services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html. 
Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the course of the semester may consider 
taking time away from their coursework and research responsibilities. All female students who 
give birth to a child while engaged in coursework or research are eligible to take either a short-
term absence or formal leave of absence. Students in course work should consider either 
working with their course instructor to receive incomplete grades or elect to drop to part-time 
status or to take a semester leave of absence.  Students engaged in research must work with 
their faculty to develop plans for the research for the time they are away.  
● 
Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity 
Accommodations. Students will complete an information form and meet with a member of the 
Dean’s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student. 
○ 
Planning for the student’s discussion with appropriate academic contact(s) 
(advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting. 
● 
Students in course work should consider options for the semester of the anticipated 
birth such as working with their course instructors to receive incomplete grades, electing to 
drop to part-time status or taking a full semester leave of absence. 
● 
Students engaged in research must work with their faculty to develop plans for the 
research for the time they are away and for resuming upon return. 
● 
Master's students who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are 
eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short-Term 
Maternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding 
may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six 
weeks is medically necessary. To receive this support students must be registered with the 
Office of the Dean of Students. 
Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university faculty and staff as soon as possible 
as they begin making plans regarding time away.   Students must contact the Office of the Dean 
of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations.  Students will complete an 
information form and meet with a member of Dean’s Office staff to determine resources and 
33 
 
procedures appropriate for the individual student. Planning for the student’s discussion with 
her academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) will be reviewed during this meeting. 
11.6 Statute of Limitations 
As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations, www.cmu.edu/policies/student-
and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html, students must complete all 
requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years from original 
matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school 
or college policy.  Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work 
towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master’s degree program 
under criteria determined by that program. 
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or 
parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's 
recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a 
period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing a 
master’s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their 
program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree 
limit.  
Any request for a waiver of the statute of limitations must be approved by the Department Head 
and by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the 
exceptional circumstances that warrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, 
the waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the 
program. 
See also the ‘Duration of Study’ policy. 
11.7 Residency Requirement 
The MSAII is a full-time, in-residence program conducted only on the Pittsburgh campus.  In 
exceptional circumstances, such as visa complications or medical exigencies, permission may be 
granted by the Director allowing a student to participate in short portions of the program 
remotely.  This is not possible for first-year students. 
12 Financial Issues 
12.1 Graduate Student Funding  
34 
 
The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs.  
Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and support from other sources.  The HUB website 
(https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html) provides the Graduate Financial 
Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial aid and other 
helpful links.  Additional information on financial issues for graduate students can be found on 
the web at www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/. 
Students in the professional MS programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching 
Assistants and Research Assistants.  However, typically full-time MS students do not have time 
for these activities.  Typically Research Assistantships are most likely to be awarded to students 
in Carnegie Mellon’s research-oriented degree programs. 
12.2 University Financial Aid 
Graduate students should consult the graduate student financial aid information found on The 
HUB website: www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html.  Students will find the 
Graduate Financial Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for financial 
aid and other helpful links. 
12.3 Health Insurance  
Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking 
students to carry adequate medical insurance. Students must either purchase the plan offered by 
the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the student is “enrolled as the 
dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance 
plan” (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-health-insurance.html).  
It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student Health Services to 
either pay for their insurance at the beginning of the semester, or elect a payment plan over the 
course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web 
site www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/.  
12.4 Emergency Loans  
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/ 
All students regardless of their program are eligible for the Emergency Student Loan, which is an 
interest-free and emergency-based loan repayable within 30 days. It is available through the 
Office of the Dean of Student Affairs; students may apply for the loan by stopping in to the 
Student Affairs Office, Warner Hall 321, or by calling (412) 268-2075 for an appointment.

and counsel to students and families regarding financial aid, billing and payment, registration 
and academic records. The Assistant Directors in The HUB serve as contacts for specific colleges 
and assist enrolled students with key aspects of the enrollment process.  A student can find their 
assigned HUB Assistant Director on their Student Information Online (SIO) Resource 
page.  Questions that need specialized, in-depth attention can be directed to the student's 
assigned Assistant Director.  For general questions and information, students may email The 
HUB or call 412-268-8186. 
13.2 Student Information Online (SIO)  
Student Information Online (SIO) is a secure site where students can find important, 
personalized information, including E-Bills and student account information, financial aid status 
and eligibility, grades and QPA, and course schedules. Students can update their and their 
spouse’s or domestic partner's contact information, sign up for E-Check & E-Refund, authorize 
their spouses, domestic partners or another individual to receive a copy of their E-Bill, request 
verifications, view their housing and meal plan assignments, and much more. Students can log 
on to SIO by going to www.cmu.edu/hub/sio and entering their Andrew User ID and password. 
On SIO, students will designate an emergency contact address of a relative or family friend to be 
contacted in the case of an emergency.   If students do not want their name and address 
published in the campus directory, they must notify the HUB in writing. 
13.3 ID Cards 
Graduate students can obtain their ID card from The HUB once they have been entered into SIO 
for the semester.  These cards identify their holders as members of the campus community.  
Student cards are deactivated upon the cardholder’s separation from the university. 
Affiliate ID Cards are available for spouses and partners of graduate students that allow them to 
access Carnegie Mellon’s campus.  These cards are available through The HUB to spouses and 
partners of graduate students who are enrolled for the current academic year in a full-time 
graduate degree program.  The card is valid for one year.   For information about domestic 
partner registration, visit the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs webpage:

13.5 Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-registration 
www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/cross/index.html 
Cross-registration provides an opportunity for enriched educational programs by permitting 
full-time graduate students to cross-register for courses (usually no more than one per semester) 
at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution. Full-time Carnegie Mellon 
degree students are eligible and the PCHE course may not count towards full-time status unless 
the student is enrolled in an inter-university program. Students interested in taking advantage 
of this opportunity should be familiar with the Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses already 
outlined previously in this handbook. 
Department specific information about graduate students’ ability to cross register and transfer 
grades should be included here. 
13.6 Student Privacy Rights and FERPA 
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/privacy-rights-students.html 
This university policy notifies students of their rights under the federal Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  According to FERPA, students have the right to: 
 inspect and review their education records;  
 request an amendment to their education record if they believe they are inaccurate or 
misleading; 
 request a hearing if their request for an amendment is not resolved to their satisfaction; 
 consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information from their education records, 
except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent; 
 file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Family Policy Compliance Office 
if they believe their rights under FERPA have been violated. 
37 
 
For questions about Student Privacy Rights, FERPA or filing a complaint, contact John 
Papinchak, University Registrar, jp7p@andrew.cmu.edu, in Enrollment Services. 
13.7 Academic Calendar 
The official academic calendar is published by Enrollment Services.  It is not uncommon for 
departments and colleges to have academic requirements that differ from or are in addition to 
those presented in the academic calendar provided to the campus community by Enrollment 
Services.  See https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/docs/2223-academic-calendar.pdf.. 
13.8 Professional Development 
The Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) (www.cmu.edu/career/)at Carnegie 
Mellon is a centralized career center staffed by a team of seasoned and highly-educated 
professionals who orchestrate the career exploration, experiential learning, and career 
networking needs of students and alumni.  
Carnegie Mellon's career and professional development model is grounded in discipline-specific 
career development, experiential learning, and employer relations shaped by strong connections 
with the university's seven academic colleges. The center's success is founded upon a solid 
understanding of career and professional development theory, integration of technology, and an 
unwavering commitment to providing personalized attention towards meeting the unique 
individual needs of students, alumni, and employers.  The CDPC is located on the second floor of

14.2.2 Student Academic Success Center 
https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/ 
Student Academic Support Programs 
Tartan Scholars 
 The Tartan Scholars program was created to provide support for limited resourced 
students through an intentional first year undergraduate experience with the goals of 
enhancing the cohort’s skill and community building through a lens of self -authorship, 
growth mindset, and a sense of belonging. As part of the Student Academic Success 
Center, Tartan Scholars are invited to join the University and participate in summer 
initiatives and pre-orientation activities prior to their first year at the University.  
 
 There are opportunities for graduate students to serve as accountability, learning, or 
development partners, workshop facilitators, and presenters. Contact Diane Hightower 
at ddhighto@andrew.cmu.edu for more details. 
 
Learning Support 
 Supplemental Instruction: Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an academic support model 
that utilizes peer-assisted study sessions. The SI program provides regularly scheduled 
review sessions on course materials outside the classroom. SI is a non-remedial approach 
to learning as the program targets high-risk courses and is available in select courses 
based on data related to past student performance and feasibility.  
 Peer Tutoring: Weekly Tutoring Appointments are offered in a one-on-one and small 
group format to students from any discipline who need assistance with a course that may 
not be supported by our other services. Weekly appointments give students the 
opportunity to interact regularly with the same tutor to facilitate deeper understanding 
47 
 
of concepts. Students can register online through the Student Academic Success website.   
 Academic Coaching: Academic Coaching provides holistic one-on-one peer support and 
group workshops to help students find and implement their conditions for success.  We 
assist students in improving time management, productive habits, organization, stress 
management, and study skills.  Students will request support through the Academic 
Success Center website and attend in-person meetings or meet using video and audio 
conferencing technology to provide all students with support.  
 “Just in Time” Workshops: The Student Academic Success team is available to partner 
with instructors and departments to identify skills or concepts that would benefit from 
supplemental offerings (workshops, boot camps) to support students’ academic success 
and learning.  We are eager to help convene and coordinate outside of the classroom 
skill-building opportunities that can be open to any student interested in building skill 
or reinforcing course concept mastery. 
 Study Partners: Support for students to create and benefit from their own study groups: 
The Student Academic Success team assists students in forming and benefiting from peer 
study groups, whereby all students can reap the benefits of peer-to-peer learning, 
student agency, and collaboration skill development. Staff from the Student Academic 
Success Center will be made available to instructors and students to assist with the 
formation of peer-led study groups.  This level of support is open to any course where the 
instructor requests or agrees such support is appropriate and students are interested in 
both leading and participating.   
 
Language and Cross-cultural Support  
More than 60% of graduate students at Carnegie Mellon are international students, and others 
are nonnative speakers of English who have attended high school or undergraduate programs in 
the US. Many of these students want to hone their language and cross-cultural skills for 
academic and professional success. Students can choose from sessions on  
 how to give a strong presentation,  
 writing academic emails,  
 expectations and strategies for clear academic writing,  
 how to talk about yourself as a professional in the U.S.,  
 developing clearer pronunciation,  
 using accurate grammar, 
 building fluency, and more.  
 Students can make an appointment with a Language Development Specialist to get 
individualized coaching on language or cross-cultural issues.  
 
The Student Academic Success Center is also charged with certifying the language of 
International Teaching Assistants (ITAs), ensuring that nonnative English speakers have the 
language proficiency needed to succeed as teaching assistants in the Carnegie Mellon classroom. 
48 
 
Students preparing to do an ITA Certification should plan to take classes offered by the 
language support team at the SASC from the beginning of their first semester. Start by 
contacting the language support team at the SASC website or attend a Language Support 
Orientation at the SASC or in your department.
