The time variation of HET efficiency is considered in the calculation of the exposure map. P o S ( I C R C 2 0 2 3 ) 6 7 0 corrected by taking the efficiency change into account. The DAMPE ùõæ-ray performance with the latest calibration and data selection is presented in Fig. 3. With the calibrated IRFs, the map of the integrated flux above 2 GeV can be calculated and is shown in Fig. 4. Lots of structures and point sources are visible in the map, and some of them are analyzed as presented in Sec. 3.
