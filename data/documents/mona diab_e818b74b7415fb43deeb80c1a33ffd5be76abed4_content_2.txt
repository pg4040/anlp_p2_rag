showed that 2H-TPyP and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru induced PARP cleavage as shown by the highly apparent 89 kDa cleavage fragment for HCT116 (Figure 12A) and HT-29 (Figure 12B) cell lines, associated with a decreased expression of the native PARP in treated cells compared to control at 24 and 48h. 2.5.4. DNA fragmentation In order to study the nuclear changes in apoptosis caused by 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyParene-Ru, DNA fragmentation was evaluated by ELISA assay in both cell lines after 24 and 48h. The outcomes indicate that in HCT116 cells (Figure 13A-B), 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru-PDT leads to a significant increase in DNA fragmentation by 3.7-fold at 24h and 5.6-fold at 48h compared to non-irradiated conditions 1.3-fold and 0.8-fold respectively compared to control. Similarly, Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru coupled with PDT increased DNA fragmentation by 2.4-fold and 1.2-fold at 24 and 48h respectively compared to non-irradiated conditions 1.4-fold and 0.7-fold compared to control. HT-29 cells showed similar results (Figure 13C-D), 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru coupled with PDT induce a significant increase in DNA fragmentation by 3.3-fold at 24h and 5.4-fold at 48h, whereas the nonirradiated condition showed no significant effect with 0.7-fold and 1.0-fold respectively compared to control. Likewise, Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru with PDT increased DNA fragmentation mainly at 48h by 1.9- fold compared to non-irradiated condition 1.0-fold compared to control. Figure 13. Effects of photoactivation of TPyP-arene-Ru on DNA fragmentation HCT116 (A-B) and HT-29 (C-D) cells. Cells were grown for 36h in an appropriate culture medium before exposure or not to 2H-TPyP or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru complexes at IC50 concentrations. After 24h incubation, cells were irradiated or not with a 630-660 nm CURElight lamp at 75 J/cm2 (PhotoCure ASA, Oslo, Norway). DNA fragmentation in both cell lines 24h post-PDT (A-C) and 48h post-PDT (B-D) was quantified from cytosol extracts by ELISA. Results are reported as n-fold compared to control. Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n= 3). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001.
