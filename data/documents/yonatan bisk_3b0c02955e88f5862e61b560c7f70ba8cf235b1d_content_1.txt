Section: H.2 Robot Setup
Visualizing The Robot We use RVIZ, a part of ROS, to visualize results and progress. Fig. 22 shows three different outputs from our system: on the far left, an image from the test environment being processed by Detic; in the center, a top-down map generated by the navigation planner described in Sec. E.2; and on the right, an image from RVIZ with the point cloud from the robotâ€™s head camera registered against the 2D lidar map created by Hector SLAM. One advantage of the HomeRobot stack is that it is designed to work with existing debugging tools - especially ROS [113]. ROS is a widely-used framework for robotics software development that comes with a lot of online resources, official support from Hello Robot, and a rich and thriving open-source community with wide industry backing.
