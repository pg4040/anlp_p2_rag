Section: A Appendix
A.1 Datasets and System Outputs In this section, we list all datasets for which GlobalBench has submissions of system outputs. Text Classification GlobalBench covers the following datasets for this task: the QC (Question Classification) dataset (Li and Roth, 2002), the ATIS (Airline Travel Information Systems) dataset (Hemphill et al., 1990), the MR (Movie Review) dataset (Pang and Lee, 2005), the SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) Corpus (Socher et al., 2013), datasets from GLUE (the General Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018), and the Code-Switching Corpus (Ostapenko et al., 2022). Sequence Labeling GlobalBench covers the following datasets for this task: the MasakhaNER Corpus (Adelani et al., 2021), the CoNLL-2003 dataset (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), and the PAN-X dataset (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019). Text Pair Classification GlobalBench covers the following datasets for this task: the Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI) corpus (Conneau et al., 2018), the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus (Bowman et al., 2015), and the Sentences Involving Compositional Knowldedge (SICK) dataset (Marelli et al., 2014). Question Answering GlobalBench covers the following datasets for this task: XQuAD (Artetxe et al., 2019), TyDiQA (Clark et al., 2020), SDQA (Faisal et al., 2021), and MLQA (Lewis et al., 2019). Conditional Generation GlobalBench covers the following datasets for this task: datasets from the Fifth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT20) shared tasks6 and datasets from the Gaokao benchmark (Yuan and Liu, 2022). KG Prediction GlobalBench covers the following datasets for this task: WordNet18RR (Shang et al., 2019), FB15K-237 (Bordes et al., 2013). 6https://www.statmt.org/wmt20/ A.2 Visualization of System Performance across Language populations We visualize system performances across language populations for each task with at least one system output, as shown in Figure 6. A.3 GlobalBench UI Figure 7 shows the User Interface of GlobalBench Text Pair Classification task. On the top left of the webpage, there is a brief description of the task. Participants will be able to see the statistics of all analyses. For instance, under the DemographicWeighted Global Average analysis, there is the overall Demographic Average of this task and the diachronic figure representing how the the overall Demographic Average of this task has changed over time.
