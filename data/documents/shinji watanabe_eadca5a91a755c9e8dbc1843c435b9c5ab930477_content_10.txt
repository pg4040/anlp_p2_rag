with k and l respectively in the former case and also with h and k being replaced with l and h respectively in the latter case. These results show that ε1(qx , 0, qz) = ε1(−qx , 0,−qz) and ε1(0, qy , qz) = ε1(0,−qy ,−qz). (12) J1(SixSjx + SiySjy)|5�i|6�j = J1 2 (S+i S − j + S−i S+j )|5�i|6�j =6J1|6�i|5�j .

The result shows that ε1(qx , qx , qz) = ε1(−qx ,−qx ,−qz) , namely, nonreciprocal excitation appears, which is most prominent at (h, k, l) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) . This indicates that the point P and P’ in the reciprocal lattice space (see inset in Fig. 6C) are not equivalent. This explains the result shown in Fig. 3 where the nonreciprocal excitation ωm′(q) �= −ωm′(q) appears along the N-P-Ŵ line. We show εm′(q) for m′ = 1, 2, . . . , 12 for q along the symmetry line displayed in the inset of Fig. 6C. We note that ε1(−q) (blue dashed line) at the P point in Fig. 6C is equivalent to the energy at P’ in Fig. 6B. As discussed in Fig. 6B, the nonreciprocal excitation is remarkable along the N-P-Ŵ line not only for the first excited state, i.e., m′ = 1 , but also for m′ > 1 as shown in Fig. 6C. These behaviors are consistent with the nonreciprocal feature emerging prominently along the N-P-Ŵ line in Fig. 3. It is noted that to demonstrate the emergence of the analytic form of the sin function [see Eq. (18)], here we discuss the energy dispersion εm′(q) for the N.N. interaction J1 in Fig. 6C. Since the energy dispersion ωm′(q) is plotted in Fig. 3 after subtraction of the ground state energy [see the denominator in r.h.s. of Eq. (10)] for not only the
