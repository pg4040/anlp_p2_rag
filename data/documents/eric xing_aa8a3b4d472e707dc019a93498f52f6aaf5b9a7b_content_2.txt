= 0.8, chaos can exist in the three cases. 5.2 Finding chaos via the dependence of Kc on varying one or two parameters In fact, the dependence of Kc on varying one or two parameters can better provide some insight into the transition from regularity to chaos than the technique of Poincaré map. Fig. 14 The dependence of Kc on two varying parameters for the case of electrically neutral particles. The magnetic charge p = 0.1 and spin a = 0.1 are adopted. a The two parameters relate to the black hole charge q and magnetic field strength B. There are the particle energy E = 0.998, angular momentum L = 4.5, and initial separation r = 30. b The two parameters are the black hole charge q and particle energy E . There are the magnetic field strength B = 5×10−4, angular momentum L = 4.7 and initial separation radius r = 30. c The two parameters deal with the black hole charge q and angular momentum L . There are the particle energy E = 0.998, magnetic field strength B = 4.5 × 10−4, and initial radius r = 45 Fig. 15 The dependence of Kc on two varying parameters for the case of electrically negative or positive particles. a The two parameters relate to q and e < 0. There are B = 4 × 10−4, E = 0.998, L = 5.7, a = p = 0.1, and the initial separation r = 40. b Same as a but e > 0. There are B = 3.5 × 10−4, E = 0.998, L = 5.6, a = p = 0.1, and the initial separation r = 30. c The two parameters relate to p and e < 0. There are B = 3.5 × 10−4, E = 0.998, L = 4.4, a = 0.1, q = 0.1, and the initial separation r = 30. d Same as c but e > 0. There are B = 3.5 × 10−4, E = 0.998, L = 6, a = 0.1, q = 0.1, and the initial separation r = 30 Figure 13 plots the dependence of Kc on varying one parameter. Here, we take N2 = 10,000. For a given parameter, the value of Kc is not obtained until the integration time reaches 107. The values of 0 ≤ Kc < 0.5 indicate the regularity, whereas those of 0.5 ≤ Kc ≤ 1 correspond to the chaoticity. When the magnetic field B spans 3.6 × 10−4 in Fig. 13a,
