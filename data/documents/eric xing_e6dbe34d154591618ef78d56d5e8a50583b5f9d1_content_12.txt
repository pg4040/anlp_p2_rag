loss315 ℓCN(ϕ(C; f,A),X) = ∥X −X ⊗ ϕ(C; f,A)∥ 2 F where the context-specific correlation matrix is reconstructed as ρ̂2 = ϕ(C; f̂ , Â)⊗ ϕ(C; f̂ , Â)T .316 Baselines317 We compare contextualized modeling with several traditional approaches for context-controlled and context-agnostic318 inference, including population modeling, cluster modeling, and cohort modeling (Fig. 7). A population model as-319 sumes that the entire sample population is identically distributed. As a result, population modeling infers a single320 model representing all observations. In reality, sample populations often contains two or more uniquely distributed321 subpopulations. If we expect that there are several subpopulations with many observations each, and that these subpop-322 ulations can be stratified by context, it may be appropriate to cluster the data by context to identify these subpopulations323 and then infer a model for each context-clustered subpopulation. This assumes that all context features are equally324 important and therefore does not tolerate noise features well. Alternatively, when subpopulation groupings are known325 to be determined by a few important features, cohort modeling is more appropriate. Sample cohorts can be identified326 based on prior knowledge about important context features (e.g. disease type).327 14 The baseline modeling regimes enjoy the benefits of traditional inference methods (i.e. identifiability, conver-328 gence) by relying on the assumption there are a discrete number of subpopulations underlying the observed data that329 are each defined by a latent model, and each of these subpopulations is well-sampled. This assumption is rarely, if330 ever, satisfied in a real-world setting. We develop contextualized modeling as a synthesis between traditional statis-331 tical inference and modern deep learning to enable model-based analysis of heterogeneous real data. Contextualized332 modeling assumes a functional dependency between models, but unlike prior methods makes no assumption about the333 form or complexity of this dependency. As such, contextualized models permit context-informed inference even when334 contexts are sparsely sampled and high dimensional.335 Data336 Our dataset is constructed from The Cancer Genome Atlas2 (TCGA) and related studies, covering 7997 samples337 from 7648 patients with 6397 samples for training and validation and 1600 as testing. For context, we use clinical338 information, biopsy composition, SCNAs and cancer-driving SNVs (Appendix S2). Gene expression data was log-339 transformed and compressed to a set of cancer driver genes, then transformed using PCA into 50 metagenes. Networks340 were learned on the metagene expression data.341 Code availability342 All methods are available in ContextualizedML, an open-source PyTorch library for contextualized modeling. Con-343 textualized graphical models, as well as contextualized regressors can be estimated using an intuitive sklearn-style344 import-fit-predict workflow.345 from contextualized.easy import
