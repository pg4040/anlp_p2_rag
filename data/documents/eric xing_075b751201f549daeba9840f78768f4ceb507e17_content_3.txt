undiscovered variables. As the graph is of finite size and all variables in ZA have directed paths ending at active variables in A, the active variable a farthest from the root does not have siblings in ZA; otherwise, there would be a′ (i.e., the child of a’s sibling in ZA) in A that was further from the root than a. In sum, we have shown that there will exist at least one update at each iteration, and each update will lead to the discovery of new latent variables and correct causal structures. Therefore, Algorithm 1 can successfully identify the underlying hierarchical causal graph and each latent variable up to one-to-one mappings. B.4 Illustration of a Specific Case Figure 7 shows a specific case to demonstrate how we can avoid assuming specific functional classes. For active set A = {z2, z4, z5}, if we treat z2 as v1, z1 will become z in the basis and [z4, z5] will become v2. This set of (z,v1,v2) satisfies Assumption 2-i, as all information about z1 is contained by z2, z4, and z5. Assumption 2-iii and Assumption 2-ii are direct consequences of Assumption 3.3-iv and Assumption 3.3-iii. Also, we can always find an independent variable s1 := εz2 in the basis model. Therefore, Theorem 3.4 guarantees the estimated ẑ to be a one-to-one mapping of z1.
