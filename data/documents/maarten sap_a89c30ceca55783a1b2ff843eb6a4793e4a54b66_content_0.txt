Section: E Contextual Automatic Evaluation
We present the contextual automated evaluation results for each task-specific dataset. Figures 23 and 24 illustrate the formality change results for document-level and conversation-level datasets, respectively. Figures 25 and 26 display the sentiment transfer results for document-level and conversation-level datasets, respectively. Figures 27, 28, and 29 depict the de-toxification results for conversational datasets. All of these figures exhibit similar trends to the aggregate results across all tasks and datasets presented in Figure 3 and they align with the findings from our contextual human evaluation study. E.1 Correlation with Human Judgments Similar to §D.1, we measure the Spearman rank ρ correlation and Kendall’s τ correlation for the samples used during human evaluation in §5.1. Refer to Tables 13 – 15 for the correlation scores of non-contextual evaluation metrics with human judgments for each task.
