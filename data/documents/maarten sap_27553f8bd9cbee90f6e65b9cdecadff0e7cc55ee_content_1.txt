Section: 4.1 Machine Stories with Power Dyads
shows the entities identified by RIVETER that have the highest and lowest power scores, using the lexicon from Sap et al. (2017). Characters like Miss Lucas have higher power scores, while characters like Elizabeth have lower power scores. By using RIVETER’s functionality to pull out the documents contributing to an entity’s score, we find that a mistaken entity, “her eyes,” indeed often occurs in low power roles, as in “Miss Bingley fixed her eyes on face,” providing an intuitive validation of the results. This plot also shows the standard deviation across bootstrapped samples of the novel, indicating the overlapping instability of many of the power scores for this single novel. Figure 7 shows the lexicon verbs contributing most frequently to each pronoun group’s power score. For example, we see that feminine pronouns are frequently used as subjects of the verb “hear”— emphasizing women’s low-power role of waiting to hear news. We also observe that while feminine pronouns are often placed in high-power positions at rates similar to masculine pronouns, they have higher frequencies for low-power positions. In other words, in Austen’s world, masculine and feminine entities both engage in high-power actions, but feminine entities engage in more low-power actions. Arguably, though, some of the low-power positions are used by the feminine entities to obtain power, e.g., by “hearing” news or eavesdropping on others, the feminine entities can learn information that informs their future decisions and strategies.
